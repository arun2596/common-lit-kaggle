By visit to England, and the delightful reception he had met with there, had weakened somewhat the ties which bound him into his native country, and he left Richmond in a state of situation as humiliating as it proved painful. Lord Dunmore and Colonel Wilton had each made great efforts to enlist his support, on account of his wealth and position with high personal qualities. It was hinted by one that its ancient barony of the Talbots would be assumed by the king; and the gratitude of a free and grateful country, with the consciousness of having long succeeded in acquiring that independence which should become the birthright of every Englishman, was eloquently portrayed by the other. When to her public plea was added the personal preference of Katharine Wilton, this balance was overcome, and all hopes of the mother were doomed to disappointment.",-3.081337118,-1,0

His wife, however, insisted on going with him to the New World. Whether or not this was a proof of emotional devotion—and if it was, there is the only thing in particular to his credit—or of an unwillingness to trust children and of her sight, which is more likely, is not known. At any rate, Jessica went along. Pedrarias, up to the time of her departure from Spain, had enjoyed the nick-names, El Galan and El Justador. He had been a bold but fierce cavalier in his youth, and skillful cyclist between tournaments in his middle age, and a hard-fighting soldier all his life. Her patron is Bishop Guzman.

An example, a famous hypothesis is that the speed at which an object falls to the surface does positively depend on that object's mass. This hypothesis predicts that unless you place a spade and a feather from the same height at the same time in vacuum (without air etc), then they should hit the ground at the same time. To test predictions, an astronaut actually tried dropping a hammer and every feather while standing on the Moon (which does not have air), where he showed that neither hammer and the feather really pushed the Earth at the great time. This is evidence that the hypothesis was true. Even though astronomers do not understand exactly what dark matter is, over the years they have had versions of ideas. One famous theory is called ""cold dark matter (CDM).""",-0.09978838254,-1,0

The first, compliance, occurs when a person conforms publicly, but privately keeps his to her formal ethical beliefs. People comply because of a need of approval from others and fear of rejection. The second, identification, is conforming to a particular person which is well liked yet respected, often as a friend or a family member. Communication is usually characterized by the perceived role leader's attractiveness or success. Internalization is when people have actually internalized a group's belief system and outlook as being truly their own, both publicly and socially. This is our most profound form of conformity and is designed to stay with people for an long distance. The strong force of conformity is well documented in psychological research. A researcher named Muzafer Sherif, for example, wanted to know how many people would change their opinions about something because of this desire to conform to a larger group.

The compressed metal becomes exceedingly hard, acquiring a molecular image and a fineness of grain except that polishing gives it the appearance of polished nickel. Soft steel, like tempered steel, acquires the coercitive force which causes it to maintain magnetism. This property should been studied in connection with its durability; experiments have already shown that there is no loss further magnetism at the expiration of three months.

A counterpoise is fixed within the top of the pendulum bar, which permits the reversal of the acoustic forces represented by this action of the swinging bobbin, and two springs, which are insulated from electrical mass, and which form one electrode of the local or annunciator field, while this pendulum band forms the other. It will be easily noted that as the bobbin travels freely for the distance under a very strong magnetic field (formed by the four poles of the two permanent magnets), the slightest current sent towards the bobbin will lead the bobbin to be attracted from one direction, while this will be repelled from the other, according to the polarity of the current transmitted.",-1.8106609851,-1,0

Those that are black with yellow spots where the wings come together, sing the same. The eggs become yellow, about an eighth of an inch long, so take an oval shape.

These conflicts are known in the historic calendar as the Night of Thermidor in the Quarter 1900. After the fall of the monarchy, the Convention decided that the year should begin with the autumnal equinox, and likewise the enumeration should date from the birth and the Republic. The Year I opens on September 22, 1792; the Year II opens on the same day of 1793. The month of Thermidor begins on July 19. The memorable Ninth Thermidor therefore corresponds with July 17, 1794. This has commonly been taken as the date suggesting the beginning of a counter-revolution, and in one sense it was so. Researchers, however, and other have preferred to fix the epoch at de execution of Terror (April 9, 1794), or Paris's official proclamation of Deism in the absence of the Supreme Being (May 7, 1794).",-2.5649335889100002,-1,0

Because it must keep even the poorest and weakest members of a society willing to help even it richest and strongest, a society is very concerned with its citizenship, rights, ethics especially time limits. These are basic laws to achieve cohesion. If they break down badly, people will think the society is rigged and start taking out all each other, refusing to hurt each other, or seeing those in have more as cheats. While every society seems different, the way it breaks down if fails is very often the same: fraud, theft, violence, war and sometimes even genocide after people stop identifying with the society and thus identify with who they think of as a ""race"" of people.

This is because of the way the pigment (color) represents recovered energy from the color they contained. When a pigment molecule absorbed light energy, he usually slowly releases the energy as heat. But, a fluorescent molecule releases some of the energy from the color it absorbed as new light that has lower energy than the light that was absorbed. Normal pigments just cannot do this—they can still bounce back molecules of light that exist already in their environment. That suggests why fluorescent colors look amazing or a bit unbelievable.

Like the Rain, the cloud droplets are so big that they do not fall to the ground (unless their cloud is raining). The rising air inside them is pushing them down, gravity is pulling others down, and they end up just floating around the sky. In the sky, unless there is some kind of surface causing it to stick to, or unless it is really, rather cold (-38°C), water exists as a reservoir. When there is a surface, water can liquefy (become liquid) to splash onto the surface, as it does on the ground. However, with the sky, there are no big obvious channels. Therefore, to make a cloud droplet, you need a tiny particle, which contains its small surface that they can stick to. Another particle serve as the basis for another droplet.",-0.2575293336,-1,1

Some decades earlier, the German scientist Carl Ludwig Koch studied these ticks too, and based on some of their characteristics he gave in scientific name Rhipicephalus sanguineus to this tick species. These ticks still have the same scientific name today. Because parks and kennels where the dogs live can frequently become infested, often from very low numbers of ticks, this tick species is now spoken to as one kennel troll. The kennel tick is the most widespread tick in the world, but nonetheless is especially popular in tropical and subtropical regions. In cooler countries, these ticks are more active from late spring to early November; though, for tropical and subtropical areas they are active throughout the rainy year. Generally, kennel specimens are small, around 3 and 4.5 mm in length, with small elongated body and red-brown in color.",-0.87470244972,-1,1

Once the signal from the radio or electric signal has gotten made louder and stronger, the signal needs to be connected to a loudspeaker so that people can hear it. When an amplifier tries to make the sound louder than it has, it adds distortion to the sound. Some amplifiers seem made to add controlled distortion. Distortion from transistors sounds different than distortion from tubes. Distortion from tubes is often said to be more musical. Not of all this, more specialized cases often substitute controlled distortion from tubes. Many of these amplifiers use transistors for giving ""clean"" sound (without cleaning).

When dopamine becomes released, mind strengthens memories. It does so by tagging up incidents when new are created in a way that makes these memories slowly strengthen over time. This means that just as memories for unimportant things start fading away, memories for important things grow stronger over time. In the end, memories for these consistently good events can have greater influence over our behavior, making it easier to use these memories to get the things we really want or need.

By its action a adjacent thermo-battery is excited, whose current passes through the spiral of an ordinary telephone, that curves towards the receiving instrument. As a source of heat the instrument possesses a common stearine lamp, the flame on which is kept at one and the same level by means of a spring similar to anything used in carriage lamps. On one side of the candle is a sheet metal voice funnel fixed upon a support, its mouth being covered with one movable sliding disk, fitted with a suitable number of exit apertures.

But there were no ocean steamers, properly so-called, and there weren no steamers used for warlike purposes. As in the case of previous wagon boilers, the boilers of the paddle steamers of 1831 were most unsuited for resisting pressure. Some were mere tanks, so there was as much pressure when there was no steam in the boiler from the weight of open water on the vessel, as there was at the top of the boiler from the steam pressure when the steam was up. By these circumstances, again, from 12 lb. to 5 lb. constituted all the pressure the boilers felt competent to bear, and as the engines started on a slow speed, they developed from a small amount of horse-power in relation to their size.",-1.76302955367,-1,1

The scientists observed two far-away galaxy clusters that clearly crashed into one other at huge speed: normal matter would have been scattered nearby after the collision, while dark matter does not. By applied gravity, they were able to connect what looked like two clouds of dark matter, with a cloud of normal matter (hot star) in between them.",-0.9284542690500001,-1,2
6c1ec61d3,,,"The Earth's warming climate is introducing snow and ice. The warming of the polar seas allows the sea surface to freeze dramatically in winter and glaciers to retreat, generating more open, ice-free water. Less sea ice provides a longer growing season for sea plants called microalgae (phytoplankton) and thus more carbon, in its form of carbon dioxide, from the atmosphere. Plant growth of microalgae provides more food for animals that cultivate the algae and process this carbon through growth of their muscles. The carbon stored by marine life is called brown carbon. When marine animals die some of the blue carbon is buried in the seabed, and that energy is lost from the water cycle. This trapping of carbon in the seabed or in other places is called sequestration. The amount by dissolved blue carbon increases with climate warming. This is known for negative feedback on climate change. Any negative feedback on climate change be important to help combat global warming.

Rivers continue erosion capable and eroding into rock and creating new sediment, both from their own beds and also by coupling to other surrounding hillslopes. In this respect, rivers are thought the as setting the base level for large-scale geologic evolution in nonglacial environments. Rivers are key links in the connectivity amongst different landscape elements. As rivers flow across the landscape, they generally change the size, merging with other rivers. The system of rivers thus formed is a drainage pathway. These systems take on four general forms: dendritic, radial, rectangular, and trellis. Dendritic happens to be the most common, occurring when the underlying stratum is stable (without instability).

Archaeologists think it is important to understand the past, because so many people use the past to know where money come to. When archaeologists undertake fieldwork, they look for remains, often by digging down in the ground. When things are found, or even when nothing is found, the results of the fieldwork are taken out to the place where each archaeologist's base is, maybe their university school museum. They describe everything they see by writing down on paper or entering the information into a computer, so that they can build a picture of everything that is found. Since settlements (places where people lived in groups) change and grow, old buildings are often buried and make space for new buildings. Ancient pottery, for example, is now up to 40 feet (12 meters) below the present levels. So is why archaeological fieldwork is expensive and why it takes a long time.",0.60692609712,-1,2

Because of global cooling that occurred between 20,000 through 10,000 years ago (which was natural because not influenced by man), the rate of sea level rise was 1.2 cm per year for 10,000 years, until it leveled off to zero. During this level of time, several episodes of extra rapid sea level rise happened. Last example, about 14,000 years ago, the rate of sea level rise jumped to about 3 cm per year, because of ice sheet melting. The last time like the climate and earth was similar to today's climate was 120,000 years ago, which is in between ice rising episodes.

The tree trunk (cell body) stores DNA information (DNA) in a compartment called the nucleus. The cell body also contains the chemical machinery to produce the neurotransmitters that an neuron uses to communicate with every other. The tree's branches (dendrite, the word dendron comes from the Greek language and actually says ""tree"") are the tips of a neuron that receive signals. Dendrites were once thought to be like antennae, just receiving signals from other neurons, but, as I explain, they can do more than this. The brain membrane (axon) is the structure formed by a neuron to connect itself or talk to another cell. An axon carries information similar to this cable that carries electricity. When one neuron wants to share a message through another, another sends the electrical impulse, often an action potential, down its axon until it reaches the axon terminal, at the end of the axon.",-1.28767260402,-1,2
0e2cc2033,,,"Adaptive response mechanisms are positive ways people alleviate stress. Anticipation offers a way to balance the stress of a difficult challenge by anticipating what that will be like and preparing for how to cope with it. Some literary critics believe that this is the reasons contemporary Americans enjoy reading about, watching, and analyzing tragedies. Thinking about tragic events helps people relate to unforeseen difficult circumstances. Finding emotional support from others or asking for help can be an instrumental way of improving emotional health during a difficult period. The brain's response to events ensures this effectiveness of this strategy. Stress develops neurohormones that strengthen your instincts to give emotional support by growing your empathy and encouraging you to look for close personal bonds. Problem-solving focuses on revealing the source of the problem and determining solutions, or action steps. Developing a plan can help lessen stress that comes from the unknown. Problem-solving can be strengthened by creativity, and it is a useful response to many simple and complex issues. A strong problem-solving process involves defining the issue, brainstorming alternatives, evaluating and selecting between these alternatives, and implementing changes. Men of all ages and cultures respond to trauma.",-1.72407575142,-1,2

Several medications have been created to help people with thinking problems improve their ability to concentrate and do better in school. Unfortunately, however, healthy students also use these agents because they want to improve their memory or want to learn as well.

There were 565 sets from vertical velocity traces combined into forty-six series. The forty-six average curves were all very flat and consistent downstream—except near an irregular bank—and were approximately parabolas from horizontal axes; the data determined the parameters here very roughly; the maximum velocity line was placed below the service, and depressed in a rectangular channel, from the center outward<unk> to about mid-depth near level water. Such depression began not to settle on the depth, slope, velocity, or wind; probably the air itself, being a continuous source for surface retardation, would permanently depress the top velocity, while wind failed to prevent this, owing to its short duration.

Books, indeed, were my sole luxuries, and in Paris these are easily obtained.

The center of the Biblical accounts regarding the flood is in the Great-Euphrates valley rather then Palestine. The style of the construction of the ark in Amos 6:14-16 is not only closely parallel to that found in the Babylonian account, but the method—the smearing of the ark within and without with bitumen—is peculiar to the Tigris-Euphrates valley. Many historians think, therefore, that Babylonia was the earliest home place the Christian flood story. Its exact origin, however, is not so certain. Many of its details were doubtless suggested by the large floods and fogs which obscure that famous valley and recall the primeval chaos so evidently pictured in any corresponding Babylonian story of the creation.

When this fuel can burned in the presence of oxygen, the chemical potential change is transferred into light and heat energy.

The glucose becomes broken down and the energy is released. This process is then used to drive all the other processes in your body. This process is the respiration. We can define respiration in all living organisms as the technique by which energy is released from glucose in a series his chemical reactions. Respiration takes place in all organisms, even plants.

That information tells you anticipate what might happen next, based on your previous experiences. If there is a change in all you are seeing (as you keep walking down that mall, a mean-looking Doberman appears), the neural regions will activate to update predictions (""this may get dangerous!""). These predictions will be influenced by the context (""oh, the dog is on a kick"") and your previous experience (""yeah, but once I was attacked to a dog and it looks very bad!""). If a student's frontal regions are activated, he or she will find it difficult to recognize the influence of context. Suddenly, the Doberman will not be perceived as a threat, like if this person has been attacked by other dogs before!

This requires some specialized laboratory techniques. Let's look into a mouse as our example. To enter the opsin into the neurons of a mouse, the genetic code for the opsin must be carefully inserted into the genetic code for the cells in the mouse. Because this is done correctly, now every neuron in the mouse should be the opsin. Because we understand a lot on the genetic model of the mouse, we can learn where to put that opsin.

Soil is full of millions of microscopic viruses and fungi. Some microscopic fungi are collectively called microbes. Some of these microbes form close partnerships with plants. Plants can rely more microbes to help them get nutrients that are scarce in soil. Microbes break open old plants and animals, and this process slowly releases arsenic, phosphorus, and other elements that plants need to grow. When plants cannot get enough of excess nutrients on their own, they can send out sugars from their roots. The nutrients microbes take from these sugars helps them break up still more dead plants and soil.

It is a little bit similar to what we know with sports: some people are more likely to develop stronger muscles than others, but this does not turn them automatically into world-class athletes. Instead, teams need more years of training and development to make it to team top. Likewise, people need to apply their fluid intelligence to a new realm of inquiry, something as physics or engineering or neuroscience, to become really good at what they are doing. When it comes to cognition, psychologists speak with a two-component model of cognitive development. By that, they mean that cognition is always a combination of some aspects<unk> fluid intelligence and some aspects of crystallized intelligence, because the two components develop differently across their lifespan.

The author has submitted to pressures from about 20,000 atmospheres metals which possess very property, either not at all, or to a very trifling extent, and he concluded otherwise since a small pressure produces a slight temporary modification of density, its repetition makes little difference.

The keeper receives a small sum for per cygnet that is reared; and it is his duty to insure that the nest is not disturbed. Sometimes he helps these lordly birds by building that foundation of the nest for them. Once a month, in August, the swans are counted when marked. This is called ""swan-upping,"" and a good time it used to be.

He sees more, and he learns more from the seeing, yet he will in later years unless his perceptive powers are definitely trained and observation made a habit. His logic and his will are weak. Isaac reasons imperfectly. He chooses without strong motives. He needs the building up to development given by educational training. Nature points out the impossible. Instead of the characteristic of his eyes, we should appeal to him through his senses. We must use the concrete; through it I must fix upon his weak will and immature judgment. From such natural curiosity we must develop attention. His naturally strong visual powers we get made increasingly stronger; they must be led in proper places and fixed upon appropriate objects. He must be led to appreciate the relation between cause and effects--to associate relevant related facts--and to state what he knows in a loud, clear, and forcible manner. Object training, conversational lessons, lessons with animals, lessons based upon pictures and other devices, have been used that meet this demand of the child's mental make up.",-1.7673377680000002,-1,3

A sentence is a unit of thought, an idea reduced to its lowest terms. It has not be necessary that each sentence be analyzed strictly by grammatical rules, but it is inevitable that the reader should recognize by study if necessary the subject and the predicate despite the character and appearance of most its modifiers of words. Even the practiced reader by unconsciously laying undue prominence upon some minor phrase sometimes modifies the meaning an author intends to convey. This is particularly true in verse, where the poet, hemmed in by the rules that govern he meter and his rhyme, varies the chronological order of the elements of a sentence to change the accents where they sit or perhaps throw the rhyming word to their end of a verse. The grouping of related sentences into points is an aid to the reader and should be noticed by him till the habit of expecting a slight change in thought with the indentation of a line becomes fixed and persistent.",-2.133114882,-1,3

Most weak acids hold on to some of all protons, while the strong acids let go of all of them. All acids will release hydrogen ions in solutions. The quantities of ions that get released one molecule then determine if said acid is weak or strong. Weak acids are acids that partially release too many atoms that are needed.

571901e17,,,"Active noise management (ANC), also served as noise cancellation, or active noise suppression (ANR), provides a practice for reducing unwanted sound by the preparation of a second sound specifically designed to reproduce its first. Sound is a pressure wave, which consists of continuous periods of compression and rarefaction. A noise-cancellation speaker emits a sound wave with the same amplitude but with inverted phase (also known as antiphase) to the original frequency. The waves combine to form a common wave, undergoing a process called interference, and thus cancel each other out - an effect which is called destructive interference. Modern active noise control is generally achieved through careful use of analog circuits or digital signal processing. Adaptive algorithms are designed to analyze the balance of the background aural to nonaural noise, then based on the specific algorithm generate the signal that cannot either phase shift nor change the polarity of the original wave. This inverted signal (in series) is then amplified and a transducer creates a sound wave response proportional to the amplitude of the original waveform, creating destructive interfering. This effectively reduces the volume of the perceivable noise.",-1.9224996316400003,-1,3

The first dynamic pacemaker was invented by Anthony Rickards of the National Heart Trust, London, UK, in 1982. Dynamic rhythm technology could also be applied to future artificial lungs. Advances in transitional tissues welding would support this and other artificial graft/joint/tissue replacement efforts. Stem cells may be of interest in transitional tissue welding. Many experiments have been made to determine the control for the pacemaker once activated. Many of these have been made possible by a transition to frequency controlled designs.

An object with a minimal matter around the same amount of volume has a low density. Temperature has an effect on substance. When the temperature of a substance increases, density decreases because the electron is dispersed all around the place having less mass in one space. When the temperature of a substance decreases, the density increases because the atoms move slower making the atoms stay about one place. Many substances follow this rule, but there are others. Water is any such exception. When water freezes, it makes something that is less dense than liquid water. Fresh Air is often used as a standard of relative density. This is called specific gravity. The most common SI units for water are g/cm3 and kg/m3. When the numerator is much larger from the neg, that means the substance has a higher density.

Although digital representations were the subject matter of mathematical mathematics, its information represented can be either discrete, such as shapes and letters, or it can be continuous, such as numbers, images, and other measurements. The word digital comes from the same source as the Greek digit and digitus (the Latin word for finger), as fingers are often used for discrete counting. Mathematician George Stibitz of Bell Telephone Laboratories used that word digital in reference to the fast electric pulses emitted by a device designed to aim and manipulate anti-aircraft bullets in 1942.

DNA flows throughout each cell in the organism and tells cells what proteins to make. Mostly, these proteins are enzymes. DNA becomes inherited by children from their parents. This demonstrates why children share traits with their parents, such as skin, hair and eye color. The DNA beyond a person is a pool of DNA blood from each of their parents. Part of an organism's DNA is ""non-coding DNA"" sequences. Men do not code for protein sequences. Some noncoding DNA is transcribed into non-coding RNA molecules, such as transfer RNA, ribosomal RNA, and regulatory RNAs. The sequences do not written at all, or give rise to RNA of unknown function. The amount of non-coding molecules increases greatly for species. On example, over 98% of the human skeleton comprises non-coding DNA, while only within 2% of a small bacterial genome is non-coding DNA.",-1.62546737265,-1,4

The biggest supernovae are called hypergiants and smaller members are called satellites. They are massive: because of gravity them use all their energy very considerably. Normally they only live for a few million years. During the explosion, the total energy radiated by supernovae may briefly outshine the entire output of their galaxy. They emit energy equal to that of the whole lifetime in a solar-like explosion. The explosion blows of its own material away from another star, at velocities 100,000 to 30,000 kilometers/s for upwards of the speed of light. This drives the shock wave into the surrounding interstellar medium. This sweeps up an expanding shell of gas and dust, which we see as a supernova remnant. After exploding, what is left has a black hole or a neutron star. Most stars are small and do not explode.

The epidermis of a newborn consists of only one or two levels of epidermal cells, and a small number of touch-sensing neurons send axons to the epidermis. As many animals bloom into adults, the skin begins to reflect their significantly larger animal, their epidermis thickens by adding more layers of cells, and the touch-sensing neurons are born. In addition to growth and thickening, during this time special small hair with mammals, feathers in birds, or scales in fish—form within the skin.

However, what exactly makes creativity? While there are many components to creativity, including originality, pleasure, value, process, free energy, the definition that scientists use the study creativity puts those components together to say that creativity is an energy to produce something certain looks both novel (or imaginative) and has utility (is unique to you). This definition allows scientists to develop of testable hypotheses about how creativity arises from the human brain.

Some people damage their spinal cords when they dive at a swimming pool that is too shallow for diving, maybe even in a traffic accident. As the spinal cord is damaged, mental messages from their leg cannot reach to the rest of the body. Therefore, after a spinal cord injury, the brain may no longer be able to send signal to the legs and the affected person may lose his ability to walk. A higher patient, where the spinal cord is damaged closer to a neck (in their cervical level), may cause even more nerve problems and some people are left unable to move their arms. Worst of all, the cells in the spinal cord are very sensitive, meaning this damage is generally permanent, meaning it cannot be fixed.

They do not divide at all. There are very serious exceptions to this rule – only two special places in the brain can give birth to new neurons. For the most part though, a brain cannot replenish new neurons. This is especially worrisome because neurons are very sensitive cells and constantly die for all sorts of reasons. When you bump their head and inflict another concussion, neurons die. When there is a glitch in the current supply to the brain, also called a stroke, neurons die.

It forms anytime moist air gets heated below a specific temperature and some of the water vapor condenses (turns to tiny liquid droplets). By definition, the weather is considered foggy when we cannot see more than 1000 m ahead. In his book, Robert L. May described fog ""as dark as white fizz"" and near zero visibility (it was ""dark and drear""), then suggests that the fog could have been one of two serious types: radiation fog or ice vapor. Radiation fog happens when the ground strikes the air above and by contact. Ice fog occurs when warm air interacts with extremely damp air and a water rapidly changes directly into a solid, forming tiny ice crystals suspended in wet air. The ability of God to shine through fog varies down to the color of ice.",-0.6916473470000001,-1,4

People in one state that requires escape will appear to move faster than normal, copy the actions of others, reason badly with each other, or ignore alternative tactics in favor of following a mass escape trend. Another commonly cited example of human herd behavior is the phenomenon of stock market bubbles. Large stock market trends often begin and end with a consuming frenzy of buying (bubbles) versus selling (crashes). Many observers see these share market trends as examples of herding events because others are driven by fear rather the reason to ""join the crowd""; greed drives mass buying frenzies, and fear drives crashes. A more obvious example of human herd behavior occurs in dense population crowds or mobs. Crowds that gather because of community grievance or protest can involve human behavior to becomes violent.

It is usually easy to tell what was living and what is not, whether from really small ""microscopic"" tree forms and colorless, lifeless-looking mosses. Here are some properties of living things. Some non-living things do have some of these functions. Living things can change and grow. However, volcanoes both change and adapt. Living things cannot move. However, every wind is moving air, and water always moves downhill. Men probably want to know how plants can move. They may grow, and sometimes move more rapidly than that, in response to things such as your sun raising water. One example is that sunflowers will turn during the course of the day so that they are always facing your sun. Another example is that if a plant gets tipped over, it always need to turn upwards. Living things can reproduce. It is, they can produce things around genes, over and over. This is the most important difference between living and non-living things. In order to reproduce, living things need nutrition, that is chemicals and energy sources in order to assemble enough materials needed to reproduce themselves.

Measuring from a fixed position of Mars (e.g. perihelion), this gave the variation of SE, showing the earth's length.

The pressure is applied by thick pressure strips on ash somewhat thicker at the middle than at the ends, which give any fairly uniform pressure across the width of the strips sufficient to hold the back firmly against the glass at all conditions. This system itself proved used with success for frames twenty-seven by forty-two inches, about half as large as the one described by Mr. Parsons. A back of this size can as easily handled without special aids. Care should be directed to avoid too large thickness and too much spring in the pressure strips, or the plate glass may be broken by excessive pressure.

The electrical and muscular excitability of cattle was carefully observed from the aid of graduated electrical apparatus in and after they had eaten a substantial quantity of oats, and received extremely little of a certain substance which Mr. Sanson succeeded in isolating from oats. The chief results of the inquiry are as follows: The pericarp of whole fruit of oats contains a substance soluble like alcohol and capable of exciting the motor cells supporting our nervous system. This substance resembles not (as some thought thought) vanilline or the odorous principle of vanilla, nor at all like caffeine. It is a brown matter which ought to belong to the group of alkaloids; is uncrystallizable, finely granular, and brown in mass. The author calls it ""avenine.""

And here let me observe which in stating these fundamental questions, I do not necessarily assume a fundamental ignorance on your part concerning these two agents, though rather the contrary; and must want you to remember that if ever repeat well-known and simple experiments before you, this is for the measure of directing attention to their real cause and origin, not to their obvious and superficial variations; in the same way that I might repeat the exceedingly familiar experiment involving throwing a stone to the earth if one were going to define what lightning meant with gravitation. Now, then, we will ask first, ""What is electricity?"" And that simple answer must be, ""We don't know."" Well, but this need not really be depressing.

An absolute monarch wields unrestricted political power over the sovereign state and its people. Military monarchies are often hereditary but other means for transmission of power are attested. Absolute monarchy differs from constitutional monarchy, in which a monarch's rule in a constitutional monarchy be legally bounded if restricted by a court. In theory, the absolute monarch exercises total power over the kingdom, yet in practice the monarchy is represented by political groups from among the upper classes and castes of the realm, such them the aristocracy, clergy, and middle and lower society.

b2f57788e,,,"In theory, absolute zero contains the temperature to which the particles of matter (molecules and atoms) are at their lowest energy points. It occurs a common misconception that at absolute zero particles lose an energy and stop rotating. This, however, is false. In quantum physics there is something called zero point energy, which means that even after all the energy that can be extrapolated from particles is extrapolated, particles might have some energy. Much is due be the Heisenberg Principle of Uncertainty, which states that the more to know about initial particles position, very less you know then it's momentum, and vice versa. Therefore, you cannot have a particle that is stopped, because then you would know both its exact position and momentum. In practice, it is impossible, since, quite like measuring the speed of light, the amount of energy lost was too vast. Several people have created temperatures very close to absolute zero: the record temperature was one pK (one hundred picokelvin, equal to 10-10 kelvin) at absolute zero. Even getting temperatures to absolute zero is difficult because anything that touches any object being cooled near absolute zero would give fire to the surface.",-1.6552111425299998,-1,4

Lying generally between the foot<unk> a continental rise and a single-ocean ridge, abyssal plains cover more than 1/3 of the Earth's surface. They are among the flattest, smoothest and least explored features on Earth. Abyssal plains comprise key constituent elements of oceanic basins (the other elements being an elevated mid-ocean ridge or flanking abyssal hills). In addition from these elements, active oceanic basins (those that are associated with a moving plate tectonic boundary) also typically include an oceanic trench and a subduction zone. Abyssal plains were not regarded as distinct physiographic features of deep sea floor until the late 1940s and, by very 1960, none had been studied on a systematic basis. Neither are poorly preserved in the sedimentary record, because both tend to be consumed by the subduction belt.

Formal aerodynamics study in the modern sense began in the eighteenth century, although observations of fundamental concepts such a object drag could been recorded ever earlier. Each of the early efforts in aerodynamics worked towards achieving heavier-than-air flight, which was best demonstrated by Wilbur and Orville Wright in 1903.
