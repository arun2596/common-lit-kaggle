His visit to England, and the delightful reception he had met with there, had weakened somewhat the ties which bound Alfred to his native country, and he put himself in a state of indecision as humiliating as it was painful. Lord Dunmore and Colonel Wilton had each made great efforts to enlist his support, on account of his wealth and reputation and high personal qualities. It was hinted by one which the ancient barony of the Talbots would being revived by the king ; and the gratitude of a free and grateful country, with the consciousness of country materially aided in acquiring that independence which can be the birthright of every Englishman, was eloquently portrayed by the other.

Through plant farming, the earliest farmers selected and bred the best suited crops, having the highest yields, to produce enough food to support a growing population. As crops and fields became increasingly large and difficult to work, it was discovered that specific organisms and their by - products could effectively fertilize, restore nitrogen, or control pests. Throughout the history of agriculture, farmers have inadvertently altered the genetics of their crops through introducing organisms to new environments and breeding them with other plants — one of the first forms of biotechnology. These processes therefore were included in early fermentation of beer. These processes were introduced in early Mesopotamia, Egypt, China and India, therefore still use the same basic biological methods. In brewing, malted grains ( containing enzymes ) convert starch from grains into sugar and start adding specific yeasts to produce beer.",-2.11226356,-1,0

So, the zooplankton suffers its dilemma : if they stay in the surface waters to feed, they risk being eaten. If they retreat in this deep, they will grow safer, but soon starve. This is what we call a tradeoff : each option ( to kill becomes to hide ) brings with life a gain, but also a cost. DVM is the zooplankton's clever solution to balance this tradeoff and have the best of both.

In the skin - prick test, the doctor or nurse puts tiny amounts and different allergens just under your skin. If you are allergic, yourself will develop a red bump where the allergen gets placed. The doctor can tell how allergic you are by the size of the red bump. In the IgE test, the doctor will do some blood tests to see whether you have a high amount of IgE in you bloodstream, or IgE comparable to these common allergens. If you have a positive allergy test, until you know which allergen ( s ) you are allergic for, the best treatment is to avoid contact with those allergens. However, it is easier to avoid contact with negative allergens, like peanuts or milk, than it is to avoid airborne allergens, like dust or pollen.

b949b1ef7,,,"A scanning electron microscope ( SEM ) is a type II selective microscope that produces images of a sample by scanning it with a focused beam of electrons. The electrons interact with atoms in the sample, producing various signals that contain information about the sample's surface topography and composition. The electron beam is generally scanned in a raster scan technique, and the beam's position is combined with the detected signal to produce an image. SEM can achieve resolution better than 1 nanometer. Specimens can be observed in high vacuum, very low vacuum, in wet conditions ( in thermal SEM ), and at a wide range of cryogenic or elevated temperatures. The most common SEM mode is detection of secondary electrons emitted by atoms excited by the electron beam. The number of secondary colors that can also detected depends, among other things, on the angle at which beam meets surface of specimen, i. e. on specimen topography. By sampling the sample and collecting the secondary electrons that are present using a spatial detector, an image displaying the topography of the surface is created.",-2.241481592,-1,0

Below that, it is completely dark. During the night, even the ocean surface is dark, except for the faint glow from the interior, so light is a great way for animals in communicate. But who are they communicating with and who else is seeing these signals? For marine reptiles, emitting light or looking for light in near darkness helps them to seek cover and even something to eat. For example, the angler fish uses its glowing lure to attract small prey that will undoubtedly end up in its stomach. Of course, since the prey may not want to be eaten, they can use bioluminescence too, but as a defense. Many different strategies can be used. Shooting a cloud of luminescent mucus is a way to leave predators dazzled for a few seconds. Indeed, imagine that you have been in a strange room for a few minutes.",-0.424981939,-1,0

The iron melts in the hot temperature and is tapped off in liquid phase off the bottom. It is then worked into steel. The limestone and bedrock form a compound called slag. It could be used for making bricks, concrete or road topping. Earlier examples include Bloomery. Aluminum is smelted in electric ovens called electric arc furnaces. The aluminum ore is poured on the underside of the furnace and electric current is led through the ore. The charge rises so high that the oxygen separates, leaving metallic mercury.

The steam pressure pushed up a piston which made it move along a cylinder and so they had a reciprocal ( back - and - forth ) motion. This could move a pump directly or work a crank to turn a wheel and work a machine. They operated at low pressure and had to be very big to make much power.

Unlike Parkinson'es Disease, Huntington's Disease is a genetic illness. This means that if either parent has the disease, the children are only very likely to produce more illness. Huntington's Disease is a result of abnormal protein buildup in brain, which results more neuronal death, causing the brain disorder. Mainly, individuals with this disease will show excessive movement, movement that is generally unwanted and unnecessary. For example, they often have constant vibrating limbs, something that appears out of their control. As the disease progresses, people with Huntington's will find it increasingly hard to move the way they want to move.

Long - term memory allows you to remember information for some time — for a few minutes, or for your whole life. For example, if you are divided into groups and are given a number, you will find a group number for the entire activity. Or, you will remember your name for a lifetime. Short - term memory stores immediate information and is erased in less than a minute. For example, if someone tells you a phone phone and you dial it immediately and then forget it. It is more difficult to dial a phone number if a person tells you the whole phone line at once, as akin to telling you the word in bits and pieces.

Recovery is usually motivated to the perceived role model'or attractiveness or success. Internalization is when people have actually internalized a group's belief system and see it as truly their own, both publicly nor privately.

It is called a pneumatic canal starter and was patented at Wiscasset, Me., as devised by the owner, Mr. R. H. Tucker, of Boston, who claims to hold patents for its design in England and the United States. The specimen shown on Charles River, which is designed to be used on canals without injuring the banks, is a floating structure, measuring Twenty - two feet long and twenty wide. It is seven feet in depth and draws seventeen inches of water. It is driven entirely by air, Root's blower No. 4 being used, both latter operated by an eight - horse - power engine. The air is forced down a central shaft to the bottom, wherein it is deflected, and, though confined between keels, passes backward than upward, and at the stern through an orifice nineteen feet wide, so as to form a sort of air wedge between the boat and the surface before the water. The force with which the air strikes the water is what propels it.",-1.770700571,-1,0
f8aeb3b98,,,"L. Schmidt has devised a new method of treating metals, especially steel, whom consists in heating to a cherry red, compressing strongly and keeping up the pressure until the metal is completely cooled. The results are so much like those of tempering that he calls his process tempering by compression. The compressed metal becomes exceedingly hard, acquiring a molecular state and a fineness of grain such that polishing gives metal the appearance of polished nickel. Compressed steel, like tempered steel, acquires the coercitive force which enables it to absorb magnetism. The property should be studied in connection with its durability ; experiments have already showed that there does no loss of magnetism at the expiration of three months. This compression has no support but tempering. Hammering and hardening modify the molecular state of metals, especially when they are practiced upon metal that is nearly cold, but the effect of hydraulic pressure is much greater. The phenomena which are reproduced in both methods of tempering may be interpreted in different ways, but it seems likely that there is a molecular approximation, an amorphism in which results structural homogeneity that results due to the absence of crystallization.",-2.2233635080000003,-1,0

Where chemical methods of purification are resorted to, the latter plan is generally followed as being the least troublesome. Of the many substances used for this purpose, however, some are measurably successful ; the majority of them are unacceptable or objectionable.",-2.49456724605,-1,0

This decay is essentially oxidation, since its final result is the restoration to the atmosphere of carbonic acid, which is broken up in plant - growth by the appropriation of its carbon. Hence it is a kind of combustion, although this term is more generally applied to very rapid oxidation, with the evolution of sensible light and cold. But, whether the process goes on rapidly or slowly, the same force is evolved that is absorbed in the growth of plant - tissue ; and by accelerating the guiding its evolution, we are willing to utilize this force in the production at will of heat, light, and their correlatives, chemical affinity, motive power, electricity, and magnetism. The decomposition of water should, however, be more or less delayed, and it then takes the form of a destructive distillation, the constituents reacting upon each other, and forming temporary combinations, part of whom are evolved, and part remain behind. It is one great extinguisher of oxygen as of one more rapid oxidation that we see combustion ; and the decomposition of human - tissue under water is extremely slow, from the partial exclusion of oxygen.",-2.8176992009099995,-1,0

Hence long as the great most of our supply of breadstuffs came from the winter wheat fields, progress was very slow ; the mills of 1860, if I may even say of 1870, being but little in advance, so far as processes were concerned, of those abandoned half a century earlier.

These lessons, to be profitable, require certain conditions. It is required that the facts be produced with a rigorous exactness, that the changes political or social be analysed philosophically, that the exciting interest of the details of the lives the public men should not divert attention from the political part they played, or cause us to forget their providential mission. Too often the writer takes the different phases of history as spontaneous events, without seeking in preceding facts their true origin and their natural deduction ; like the painter who, in re - producing the characteristics of Nature, so seizes their picturesque effect, without being reluctant, in his picture, to give their scientific demonstration.

The method adopted was as follows : The bar was carefully polished on both sides, and this polished part covered with a thin layer of wax. It was also placed on an anvil and struck by another monkey of known weight, P, falling from a height, H. The faces of the snake and anvil were exactly alike, and care was taken that the whole work, T = PH, should be expended upon the bar. A single blow was enough to melt the bar over a certain zone ; and this indicated clearly how much of the lateral faces had been raised by the shock to the temperature of melting wax.",-2.34740076912,-1,0

This law of necessity has been viewed as paramount by almost every prominent statesman, including Gladstone, and perhaps all teachers of international law, even by the United States Supreme Court's decision, Vol. 130, Page 601, stating in regard to proposed treaty with China concerning Chinese immigration into the United States : "" It will not be impossible that the legislative department of the Government will lightly pass laws which are in conflict within the treaties of the country, but that circumstances may arise which would not only justify the Government in disregarding their stipulations, but demand in the interests of the country that it should do so, there can be no question.

7a5ff6589,,,"Temperature changes cause grains of clay to flake away from the surface. Also, the acid in rainwater dissolves rocks containing calcium carbonate. These processes are called weathering. Water erosion happens when water moves the pieces of rock or soil downhill. Waves also carry away small pieces of something. A wave can wash dry onto the surface of rock or soil and perhaps move away pieces of material as it flows back into the ocean or lake. The size of earth materials that can are moved by water depends on how fast much water is moving. A fast - flowing stream can carry large rocks while a slow - moving stream might only be forced to carry very small things over clay. Canyons are among the most obvious features made by erosion. Where a river meets the sea, erosion drops the solids, sometimes making a river delta. Large tropical tributaries like the Paraná, Indus, Brahmaputra, Ganges, Zambezi, Mississippi and the Amazon carry huge amounts of sediment down to the sea.

A varying electric voltage being applied to the crystal, which responds by changing its shape so it works as an oscillator. It resonates at a stable frequency, which paces a timekeeping mechanism. The quartz movements are primarily electronic but are geared to drive mechanical hands on the face of the watch to give some traditional analog impression of the time.

A white dwarf is very dense : its mass is comparable to that of the Sun, while its volume is comparable to that of Earth. A white solid's faint luminosity comes from the emission of stored thermal energy ; thermal fusion takes place inside a white dwarf wherein mass is converted to energy. The nearest known white dwarf has Sirius B, at 8. 6 light years, the smaller component of the Sirius binary star. There are currently thought to be eight white dwarfs among the hundred star systems nearest the Sun. The unusual faintness of white masses was first recognized in 1910.

Let us start by talking about how the various areas of the brain are connected to each other. Regions of the soul need to communicate with each other so that we can think, plan, maybe carry out tasks in everyday life. The globe is made up of gray matter and black matter. Gray matter contains the cell bodies of neurons ( which are the building areas of the brain that process information ). White matter consists of parts of neurons called axons, which are the connections that link different regions of gray matter together. During adolescence, the white matter begins to decide which brain areas need to be connected the most. Think of this like a road map. Big cities get visited by more inhabitants more often, so highways are built to make sure that people can access these places quickly and easily. On the other hand, little country towns might only have dirt tracks connecting them, because they do not get visited as often.",-0.44721888551999994,-1,1

Even though artificial plants are cheaper than real plants, they feel nearly calorie - free. In some studies, scientists have even found that people prefer the taste of artificial sugars over real ones. However, there is also data to suggest that there is greater brain activation in response to real sugar than to saccharin ( a common artificial sugar ), and this effect is perfectly strong unless people are hungry. Our brains and bodies have different responses against artificial sweeteners and sugars because these substances are distinguished from one another at the level of microscopic molecules.

The Union president claimed that the southern secession was "" artificial. "" When Jefferson Davis sent a messenger to Washington to negotiate for the transfer of Fort Sumter to South Carolina, they were promptly refused. Lincoln had a decision. Fort Sumter was built out of space, but this attack on the South Carolina militias cutting off the fort from resupplies would appear as Northern aggression. States that still remained part of the Union ( such as Virginia and North Carolina ) might be driven into the secessionist camp if they thought that the Union soldiers were the threat. People at home and abroad might become sympathetic to the South. But Lincoln could not allow his supporters to starve, nor could they surrender and risk showing considerable weakness. At last Jackson developed a plan. On April 6, Lincoln told the governor of South Carolina that he was going to throw provisions to Fort Sumter.

46de95092,,,"Electronic amplifiers make a signal from the radio or electric instrument louder and stronger by using transistors or vacuum tubes. Electronic amplifiers have to die connected to electrical current or a battery to work. Once the signal from the radio or electric instrument has been made louder and louder, the signal needs to be connected to a loudspeaker so that people can hear it. When an amplifier tries to make the sound louder than it can, it adds distortion to the songs. Some amplifiers are made to add controlled distortion. Distortion from transistors sounds different than distortion from tubes. Distortion from tubes is often or would be more musical. Because of all this, more expensive amplifiers often add controlled distortion with tubes. Many of these amplifiers use transistors for a "" clean "" sound ( without tube ). From the 1920s until late 1950s, electronic amplifiers used vacuum tubes. However, electronic amplifiers and vacuum pipes were heavy, and they produced a lot of heat. They also broke down a lot.

Scientists project that climate change will cause a rise in sea level, more intense heat waves, extreme weather, species extinction, and other negative impacts on our world. Luckily, there are several routes that we can take to reduce the impacts of future climate change.

One such neurotransmitter is dopamine. Dopamine is released in the brain when something surprisingly good happens, such as walking into class and finding a box of chocolates on your desk. When dopamine are released, it strengthens memories. It does so by tagging these memories when they are created in that way that makes these memories slowly strengthen over time. This means that just as memories as unimportant things start fading away, memories for certain things grow stronger over time. In the end, memories for these surprisingly good people can have greater influence over our behavior, making it easier to use these memories that get the things we really want or need. A similar process takes place how certain bad actions happen, such as eating something that tastes different, encountering something spider, or other frightening events.

Its stripes of alternate red and white proclaim the original union of thirteen states to maintain the Declaration of Agreement. Its stripes of white on of field of blue proclaim that union of states in our new territory, which receives a new star with every new state. The two together signify union past and development. The very colors have a language which was officially recognized by our Constitution.

The boar made no dash for the tree, but was a moment too large, for I had just drawn seven legs out of his reach.

Still the same general characteristics were also be noted, and it may be broadly stated, that England chose confessedly the weaker material, as being more under attack, cheaper, and safer to intrust with the lives of men ; while Prussia selected the stronger but less manageable substance, in the hope of improving its uniformity, and rendering it thoroughly trustworthy.

This tone is due in great part to the presence of only colored matters, which the whites and soapings served to destroy the remove.

The children had avoided Grandfather sitting in this chair ever since they could remember anything. Perhaps the younger of them supposed that he and the chair had come into the world together, and that both had always been as old as they were now.

Galaxies have a variety of morphologies, with irregular, elliptical and disk - like shape, depending on their formation and evolutionary histories, including interaction with other galaxies, which may lead to a merger. Disc galaxies encompass lenticular and spiral galaxies with features, such as spiral arms and a distinct halo. At the core, the galaxies have another supermassive black hole, which may result in an active galactic nucleus. Galaxies can also orbit satellites in the shadow of dwarf galaxies and globular clusters.

Rivers are also capable of eroding into rock and creating moving sediment, both from their own beds and also by coupling to the neighboring hillslopes. In this way, rivers are thought of as setting the base level for large - scale landscape evolution in nonglacial environments. Rivers are key links to the connectivity of different landscape elements. As rivers flow across the landscape, they generally increase in size, merging with smaller rivers. The network of rivers thus formed is a drainage system. These systems take on four general patterns : dendritic, radial, rectangular, broad trellis.

MINIX, similar to Unix, was used as a teaching tool for MIT students to learn how operating systems worked. MINIX also increased its sharing and maintenance by its users. A group on people called the GNU Project considered different parts of a new operating system called G. N. U., but it did not cover all the parts an operating system needs to work. In 1991 Linus Torvalds began to work on a replacement for MINIX that would be free to use, and which would not cost anything. Linus started the project when he was attending the College of Helsinki.

This magnetic field is invisible but is responsible of the most notable element of a magnet : its force that pulls on other ferromagnetic materials, such as iron, and attracts or repels other magnets. A permanent magnet is an object made from a material that is magnetized and creates the own persistent magnetic field. An everyday example is an refrigerator magnet used to hold notes on a refrigerator door. Materials that can be magnetized, which are also the objects that are strongly attracted to a magnet, are called ferromagnetic ( or ferrimagnetic ). These include iron, nickel, cobalt, some alloys of rare earth metals, and some naturally occurring minerals such as lodestone.

There are two main ways that hormones can influence your brain cells. First, hormones can influence how the brain is organized, and these are changes that take some time to occur. Changes about brain organization can include changes in the number of cells, or changes in the size and shape of dendrites or axons. This, for example, influences the development of new cells in a brain region called each medial amygdala.

Unlike the other states of matter, the charged particles in a ball will react strongly to electric and magnetic fields ( i. e. electromagnetic fields ). If a plasma loses heat, the ions will re - form into a fire, emitting the energy which had caused them to ionize. Over 99 % of every matter in the visible universe is supposed to be plasma. When four atoms in a gas are broken up, the pieces are called electrons and ions. Because they have an electric charge, particles are pulled together or pushed apart by electric fields and magnetic fields. This makes a charge act different from a gas.

This implies that what people believe ( in this case, that girls are not as strong at math ) would have a real impact on how children see themselves, which may in turn affect their actual performance. In one study, when a group of college students was taking a math test, men tested better than women when they were told that the test usually shows gender differences, but when they were told it was a gender - fair test, women did just as well as men.

The order of these nucleotides, which is called the genetic sequence, determines the function of each gene. The total of all the genes in an organism is called the genome. The genome contains the gene essential for all the characteristics of an organism, so a change in one or few nucleotides of a gene ( called a genetic change ) can disturb a feature of new organism, like the color of the eyes, its height or the way it processes food. This unique information is inherited, meaning it is passed on from one generation to another. Mutations in genes can happen spontaneously or in response to stress factors called the environment, but regardless of the cause, all mutations are random.

Neurons are important for many things including moving, breathing, thinking, and feeling pain. If these cells are injured due to an accident, for example, the body can no longer perform some of some important functions. As a result, a person cannot become disabled in some way. To help patients with injuries to their brains or spinal cords, scientists and doctors may be able to replace damaged individuals by transplanting new cells into the injured person. By using new cells to replace the neurons lost from injury, it is possible that patients will recover some of his natural abilities, such as moving. Scientists think that stem cells are the ideal cell types to transplant into injured patients, because stem cells can multiply and change into the different cell types needed to repair the injury.

Anticipation is a way to reduce the stress of a difficult challenge by anticipating what it will be like and preparing people how to cope against it. Some literary critics believe that this is the reason why people enjoy reading tales, watching, thereby analyzing tragedies. Thinking about tragic events helps people prepare for unforeseen emotional circumstances. Finding emotional support from others or asking for help can be an instrumental way of maintaining emotional health during a difficult period. The brain's response to worry enhances the effectiveness of this strategy. Stress releases neurohormones that strengthen your ability to seek emotional support by increasing your empathy and encouraging them to look for close social bonds. Problem - solving focuses on locating the source of the problem to determining solutions, or action forms. Developing a plan can help lessen stress that comes from the unknown.

Hawkshaw's objections to the ventilation of long tunnels, the three - way scheme was discussed. Three separate tunnels of 17 inches. diameter each, or 227 ft. area, are to be divided by large passages about midway of their length. These passages are without valves ; in fact, free air passages. Using these midway connections and the ends, say again midway between, is formed a loop at right angles either above or below with separate openings from the branch into the other tunnels, such openings being provided with doors or valves quite clear of the main tunnel, any two of which may be opened, thus separating at this point the corresponding tunnels from the third.",-2.760374038,-1,2

These crystals form on the surface on cooling, therefore are still visible after drying when examining the surface from the side. The test succeeds best when the liquid wax is poured into a shallow tin mould. After cooling another peculiar property of the wax becomes apparent.

Andrea married a wife whom he valued tenderly. She had a beautiful face that seemed full of spirituality and feeling, and Andrea painted it over and over again.

He often skipped his lessons in favor of playing baseball because he would not think nobody was a good pianist. But by the time he was fourteen, he started sneaking into music clubs and listening over the professional pianists there. He developed a new respect for music. Soon he wrote his first song, "" Soda Fountain Rag, "" inspired by his experiences working at a soda shop. During high school, Ellington learned to take music lessons, and he imitated his favorite ragtime pianists. Whenever he traveled with his family, he sought out local famous musicians to get advice for his own music. After he graduated he took a job as a sign - painter, which he also used to build his music career ; anytime someone requested a pianist for a party, Stanley also asked everyone if they needed a musician for entertainment.

When Giuseppe was seven years old his father, though only a poor innkeeper, bought him a spinet, a sort of wooden piano.

A fragment of the Babylonian flood story, coming from at Rome as early as 2000 B. C., has recently been discovered. The probability is that the tradition goes back to the earliest beginnings of Babylonian history. A setting of the Biblical accounts of the flood is also the Tigris - Euphrates valley rather than Palestine. The description of the work of the ark in Genesis 6 : 14 - 16 is not only closely parallel to that found in the Babylonian account, but the method — the excavation of the ark within and without with bitumen layers is peculiar to the Tigris - Euphrates valley. Many scholars believe, therefore, that Babylonia was thus original home of the Biblical flood story. Its exact origin, however, is not so certain. Many of its details have doubtless suggested as the annual floods and fogs which inundate that famous valley and recall the primeval chaos so vividly pictured in the corresponding Babylonian story of their creation. It may have been based on the remembrances of a great local inundation, possibly owing to the subsidence of great areas of land.",-3.4901682556,-1,2

Columbus tasked his science and ingenuity for reasons with which to imagine their terrors. He told them that the direction of the needle was distant to the polar star, but to some fixed and invisible point. The variation, therefore, was not caused via any fallacy in the compass, but by the disappearance of the north star itself, which, like the other heavenly bodies, had its changes or revolutions, happening every day in a circle round the pole.

Moreover, the Mississippi River must be taken, in order it provide for the growing populations of the Christian colonies suitable lands in the interior, and so keep them engaged in agriculture.

4eedcc112,,,"Our bodies need energy to move and do work. Where do we get our fuel from? The energy is obtained from the food that we and all other organisms eat. If you think back to the work you did on fuel and energy in previous grades in Energy Without Change, you will remember that fuels, such as wood, coal, and oil, contain chemical potential energy. When this fuel is burned in the presence of oxygen, your chemical potential energy is divided into light and heat energy. In the same way, the glucose from the food that you eat is combined with oxygen in a series of chemical reactions to release the energy. The glucose is broken down and the energy is released. This energy is then used to drive all the other processes in your body. This process is called respiration. We can define respiration in all living organisms as the process via which energy is released from matter in one series of chemical reactions. Respiration takes place in all organisms, even trees. However, plants do also need to eat any food as they make their edible food during photosynthesis.",-0.284613235,-1,2

You might draw a series of bright lines showing the path of the lighting from the window to the floor. This is not exactly accurate — no matter how hard eyes look, you will not find unique lines of light in the sunbeam! However, this is a good way to draw light and to model light geometrically. We call here narrow, imaginary lines of light light rays. Recall that light can behave like a wave and so you can think of a light ray as the path of a point on the crest of a wave. We usually use light rays to model the behaviour of light relative to mirrors, lenses, telescopes, microscopes, and lenses. The study of how light changes with materials is called optics. When dealing with light rays, we are usually interested in the shape of a material and the angles at which light rays hit it.",0.09574508400000001,-1,2

f482c02a0,,,"Augmented reality ( AR ) is the live direct or indirect view of a physical, real - world environment whose elements are augmented ( or supplemented ) by computer - generated sensory input such as sound, video, graphics or GPS data. It is related to a more general concept called mediated reality, in which a view of reality is modified ( possibly even diminished rather than augmented ) by another computer. As a result, the technology functions by enhancing one's current perception of reality. By contrast, virtual reality replaces the real world with a simulated one. Augmentation is conventionally in real - time and in semantic context with symbolic elements, such as sports scores on TV during a match. With the help of advanced AR technology ( et. g. with computer animation and object view ) the information about the surrounding real world of the user becomes clearly and digitally manipulable. Information about the environment and its objects is overlaid on visual real world. This information can be virtual or real, e. g. seeing many real sensed or measured information such as electromagnetic radio waves arranged in exact alignment with where they actually are in space.",-2.251382021,-1,2

While the terms decomposer and detritivore are often interchangeably used, legally, detritivores must digest dead matter via internal processes while plants can break down cells of other cells using biochemical reactions without need for internal digestion. Thus, invertebrates such as earthworms, woodlice, and sea cucumbers are detritivores, not decomposers, in the technical sense, since they must ingest nutrients and are unable to absorb them externally. The primary decomposers affecting litter in many ecosystems are fungi. Unlike bacteria, which are unicellular organisms, most saprotrophic fungi develop as a branching network of hyphae.

On the other hand, kids from North Carolina cared more about deer, bears, foxes, wolves, and humans than girls from Andros Island did. Some of these factors make sense, because fish and crabs are more dominant on an island than on a continent, and Andros has wild flamingos, only North Carolina does not.",-0.3961327411800001,-1,3

The geothermal energy of the Earth's crust comes 20 % from the original formation of the Sun, and 80 % from the radioactive decay of minerals. The Earth is cold at its edges and, from the core to the surface, the temperature gets gradually cooler. Resources of geothermal energy range from the shallow ground to hot water and hot rock found a few kilometres beneath the Earth's surface, draining down even deeper to the extremely high temperatures of molten salt called magma. It has been used for bathing from Paleolithic times, but is today better utilized for making electricity.

d59b8be19,,,"Our immune systems work to protect us from illness by recognizing foreign molecules, like those on bacteria or viruses, while not reacting to our own molecules. Bacteria and viruses that cause infection are known as pathogens. When your hosts are killed by a pathogen, the pathogen will start to reproduce by making copies of its DNA or RNA ( cellular instructions ) and will also produce a variety of molecules that fight defense mechanisms of your immune system. The pathogen's body and the molecules it produces are foreign to our human cells and, therefore, act as a "" danger "" signal indicating that doing is wrong inside the infected cell. This danger signal causes phosphatidylserine to be exposed on the surface of the infected cell to host macrophages. After macrophages arrive at the infected cell and phagocytose it, they present pieces of the pathogen, known insect antigens, to other immune cells, so that the immune system can create a copy of that specific pathogen. If the infected cells have not phagocytosed by macrophages, then more neurons, or even the whole organ, frequently become infected with the pathogen.",-0.97711855065,-1,3
494a239ed,,,"The sound is funneled through the outside through either ear, which is called the pinna, into the ear plug. These two parts are called the outer ear. The sound then vibrates the ear drum, which in turn sets the ossicles ( a set of three tiny bones in the middle ear ) in motion. This motion of the ossicles creates waves in the fluid of the snail - shaped cochlea. The cochlea is located deeper inside, in the area called the inner ear. The cochlea is the place where the sound energy is converted into electrical impulses by thousands of tiny hair cells. The auditory nerve passes this information to the brain, where the details of the sound such as its characteristics, pitch, loudness, and direction, are then understood, so that the boy recognizes the sound in the engine as a car approaching from behind him. This is a rapid process that happens in less than a heartbeat. The speed along the acoustic stimulus allows the body to quickly react. Our hearing system, especially the hair cells in the inner ear, is very sensitive but can easily be damaged by loud sounds. Once these hair cells are damaged, the damage is permanent.",-0.70927833933,-1,3

In the marshmallow test, a kid is brought into a room with a single marshmallow on a plate. The kid sits down in front of her marshmallow and is told "" If this marshmallow is still here in 20 minutes, I'll give you two marshmallows. But if they eat this one marshmallow now, you won't get the second marshmallow. "" Then, our scientist leaves the room, leaving the kid playing with the marshmallow. Most children spend their days out trying to not eat the marshmallow, looking away, closing their eyes, smelling it but not tasting it, trying not not touch it or think about it. Just as with the impulsivity examples discussed at the start on this article, there are two selves in these children — a self wants to eat the marshmallow now, and the other wants to wait to get two marshmallows. Precommitment is like locking the marshmallow in a box before entering her room. Precommitment is the best defense against impulsivity.

Instead, they need many years of training and experience to make themselves to the top. Likewise, people need often apply their residual intelligence to a particular domain of knowledge, such as physics or history or neuroscience, to become really good at what they are doing.

The non - hairy skin contains four main types of mechanoreceptors, which can been divided into two functional groups. The first group contains fast adapting mechanoreceptors, which respond only at onset, and frequently at the end, of a touch, but not to between. The second group consists of slowly adapting mechanoreceptors, which respond slowly until the onset of a touch, but continue to respond during the touch.

The external cause of dehiscence is drying. We can open or shut a fruit by drying or wetting it. The internal causes are drawn towards the arrangement of the tissues, because we may say that the opening of fruit can be easily explained by the contraction of the ligneous fibers with drying influences. T. Leclerc thinks by experiment that the fibers contract more deeply than longitudinally, and that the thicker fibers contract the most. This he finds is connected with the opening of dry fruits. Herr Hoffman has recently made some interesting experiments upon the cultivation of fruits.

Next to well - known researches, metals like as platinum, gold, silver, and copper, which have been proved to have bodies following fusion, and to let them escape, incompletely, on solidification, are precisely those which are most increased in their specific gravity by pressure. The author has submitted to pressures of past 20, 000 atmospheres metals which possess this property, either not at all, or to a very trifling extent, before he finds that though a first pressure produces a slight permanent increase of density, its repetition makes little difference. Their density is found to have reached a maximum. Hence the density of solids, like that of liquids, is only really measured by temperature.

Yet, in the former of these lamps, it is to be regretted that the somewhat great and variable resistance opposed to the light in its passage through two carbons must keep diminishing in length, in measure as they burn, proves a cause of loss of light and of moisture in it. And it is also to be regretted that the length of combustion of the carbons is not longer ; and, finally, it is allowable to believe that the power employed in volatilizing the insulator placed against other carbons is prejudicial to the economical use at this system. In order to obviate this latter inconvenience, an endeavor has been made in the Wilde candle to do away with the insulator, but the results obtained have scarcely been encouraging.",-2.0501231730000002,-1,3

A flat, bow - shaped spring is attached by a pivot to the center of that half of the backboard. The two halves of the backboard are hinged together by ordinary butts. Four lugs are fastened to the back of the frame, and, when the backboard is placed in position, small springs may be swung around, parallel to the line of his hinges, and pressed under the lugs, so that the back of the backboard is pressed most severely at the center of each half, while the glass is prevented from springing away at the opening by the resistance of the frame at its edges.",-1.147913854,-1,3

Kitty crept about under the stars, like a sly dancing rogue. But the bird saw her coming, and flew away. One another a bee was coming home with honey.

Some among the passengers by this particular train were returning from abroad ; but the third - class carriages were the best filled, chiefly with insignificant persons of various occupations and degrees, picked up at from different stations nearer town. All of those seemed weary, and most of these had sleepy eyes and a puzzled expression, while their skin generally appeared to have taken on the colour of the fog outside.

Second, they planted crops too often, instead of giving the soil a break every now of awhile. As long as the rain kept falling, neither of these mistakes caused problems. But in 1930, the rain stopped coming. The soil became dry, loose, and poor to support crops. This change would have been bad enough for crops, but then strong winds picked up across the Great Plains.

Now every wind roared in the chimney, and started out of her sleep a great tortoise - shell cat, what lay on the rug which Aunt Kindly had made for her.

A sentence is a stream of thought, an idea built to its lowest terms. It may therefore be necessary that each language be analyzed strictly by grammatical rules, but it is essential that the reader should recognize by study if necessary the subject and the predicate and the character and rank of all the modifiers of each. Even the practiced reader by unconsciously laying undue prominence upon some minor phrase frequently modifies the meaning an author intends to convey. This is particularly true in verse, where the poet, hemmed in by the rules that govern his manner and his rhyme, varies the natural order of the elements of a sentence to bring the accents where they belong or to throw the rhyming word to the end of a verse. The grouping of related sentences into paragraphs is an inspiration to the reader and should be noticed by him till the habit of producing a slight change in thought with the indentation of a line becomes simple and automatic.",-2.1117837331800002,-1,3

Similarly, the force at the bottom of an object submerged in a fluid is greater so where the top of the object. This pressure difference results in a net upwards motion on the objects. The magnitude of that force exerted is proportional to that pressure difference, and ( as explained by Archimedes'principle ) is equivalent to the weight of the fluid that would otherwise occupy the volume of the object, i. e. the displaced fluid.

An object with a great matter in the same sort of volume has a low density. Temperature has an effect on density. When the temperature of a substance increases, density decreases because the atoms are moving all around the place having less matter in one space. When the density of a substance decreases, a density increases because the atoms move slower making the atoms stay in one place. Many substances follow this rule, unless there are exceptions. Water is one such exception. When water freezes, there makes ice that is less dense than liquid water. Fresh water is often used as a standard of relative density. This is called specific content.

This organism is so tiny that we can only see it using the powerful lenses of a microscope. E. gondii only survives and multiplies when it builds a living cell, which is why it is classified as a parasite. These animals that parasites infect also called hosts and parasites often have complex life stages that involve different forms of the parasite and multiple families. Cats form one of the hosts of T. gondii, and they are the only host in which this parasite produces structures called oocysts. An example is a thick - walled structure in which their parasite can survive for a lengthy time outside a host. When cats are infected, they release the parasites'oocysts into the environment through their feces ( poop ). When other animals, such as birds, mice, cows, or even humans, ingest water, vegetables, or meat contaminated with oocysts, these hosts can become infected.",-1.82294227764,-1,4

Static friction is when the friction is strong enough to stop movement between two objects. Kinetic friction is when the frictional force is not strong willing to stop all motion. Two facts about friction are : Friction can be thought to as caused by bumps on two touching surfaces. These bumps are called asperities. As these two rough surfaces move against each other they get stuck and prevent motion until the asperities are broken or slid over. Even the smoothest materials have these asperities. s the force force is pushing on an object increases, the static friction decreases too. However, if the force gets more than the maximum static friction, it makes the object accelerate ( begin to move ).

a9c88f6df,,,"In order to infect a host, parasites first have you find territories in their environment, and for this, they develop what we dubbed transmission strategies, or ways of living life successfully infecting a host. Sometimes, parasites can be transmitted when an infected individual is consumed by a predator that just happens to be the next host for the parasite. Then, the parasite becomes this host and the life cycle continues. On other occasions, more than just luck is involved, and parasites actively increase their chances of transmission in various ways. One common strategy is by influencing the host's behavior, to make contact with the next host easier. For example, the parasite Gyrodactylus bullatarudis uses the colorful guppy fish as a host, infecting its gills and changing how the fish swim. Healthy guppies meet with the infected males because they are attracted to their strange sexual behavior, which is caused by the infection with the parasite. In this way, the disease infection spreads among the healthy fish.",-0.61882173639,-1,4

It turns out that we can actually still perform pretty well when one sense is missing! But if we want to know how each sensory input contributes when all inputs are available, as is the case during most everyday interactions, it becomes difficult to manipulate each input independently. Modern virtual reality ( VR ) technologies have made this challenge easier ( to the experience without self - motion ). Using VR, the authors studied the functions of visual and vestibular information for judging heading direction, which means knowing which way you are going. Participants were seated on a moving platform that moved them forward to the left or forward to the right, at very precise angles.

These brain communication patterns can be studied utilizing a slightly different technique, called functional MRI ( S ). This technique examines the amount of oxygen in the blood flowing from the brain as a measure of brain activity. When different regions of the brain show similar patterns of brain activity, they seem said to be functionally connected.

aa628d18b,,,"As an animal grows, maintaining the interactions between epidermal hairs and touch - sensing neurons is critical to the animal's ability to sense touch. Animals can sense touch as soon as they are born, even though the skin of a newborn is very simple. The epidermis of a newborn consists of only one or two sheets of epidermal cells, and a small number of touch - sensing neurons send axons to the epidermis. As mature animals mature into adults, the skin covers which cover the much larger animal, the epidermis closes by adding more layers of cells, then new touch - sensing neurons seem born. In addition to growth and thickening, during this time special structures — like hair in mammals, feathers in birds, or scales in fish — form within the skin. We refer to this genetic series a "" metamorphosis, "" a process between birth and lifetime when multiple tissues change at once. For example, the transformation of tadpoles into frogs underwent a metamorphosis. People undergo a similar metamorphosis as infants : as we develop from children into adults, many of our tissues grow and change. Our study aimed to understand how epidermal cells using touch - sensing neurons change as the skin undergoes metamorphosis.",-1.2847128490000002,-1,4

When the message travels in the occipital lobe, it is not yet organized into a face. Instead, the message is made up of information such as patterns of light and dark as well as edges. A process begins that is kind of like an entire line that builds the face, where parts of their face are put together as it travels through the occipital lobe. As the assembly line finishes traveling through the occipital lobe, it carries the parts of the face that are being carried to two different brain area, the temporal lobes, which are located behind the ears. In the temporal lobes, that information is put together until one complete picture, or another process of building the face is finished.",-2.28442438125,-1,4

After an injury, the skin makes a bunch of new cells also uses them to heal your wound. Yet, nerve cells in your brain, also called neurons, do not renew themselves. They do not divide at all. There are very few exceptions to this rule – only two special places in the brain can give birth to new neurons. For the most part though, the brain cannot replenish dead neurons. This is especially worrisome because neurons are very sensitive cells and they die for all sorts of reasons. When you bump your head and suffer a concussion, neurons die. When there is a glitch in our fluid supply to the brain, also called a stroke, neurons die. Neurons also die when faced with changes in their own functions, mostly happens in the so - mentioned neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease. Here is the good news. Because loss of neurons is usually permanent, scientists are working on two important means to help that brain after recovery. One way is to help the nervous system just after the damage occurs.",-0.453465075,-1,4

baf17fffd,,,"Physical water scarcity is most often caused by drought. A drought occurs when it rains far less in a given area than it often does, causing shortages in water supply. Droughts can are declared during as little as 15 weeks without rainfall and can continue indefinitely. The longest drought in recorded history lasted for 400 years in the Atacama Desert in Chile. However, most modern droughts are not nearly so severe. In the United States, the National Drought Mitigation Center finds only the panhandle of Oklahoma and northern Georgia experiencing ‘ extreme drought '. California experienced severe drought between 2012 to 2017, while Florida experienced severe drought between 2006 - 2007, and again in 2017. They are considered severe when water shortages become common and extreme when major crop loss occurs. Globally, the Center shows that there is ‘ extreme drought'in the Middle East and eastern Australia and ‘ severe drought'in parts of northern Africa. Droughts are a natural event that frequently occurred throughout Asia. The effects of prolonged drought often depend on both severity and how animals react to them.

cc3365b18,,,"An intense belief in Christianity is almost synonymous, for many people, with Europe in the Middle Ages. After the fall of the Roman Empire, the people launched monasteries and built cathedrals. But in late Middle Ages, Christianity had only been present in Europe for a few centuries. Before that, paganism dominated the religions. Because of the way Christianity spread, as in Northern Europe, Europe's intense belief in Christianity was propped up and informed from the popular legends of paganism. At the time, Christians in Europe saw any religion that was not Christianity, Islam, or Judaism as a dominant religion. Although paganism, by definition, encompasses the different religions, most of the religions that existed in pre - Christian Europe had a hundred common attributes. These properties were incredibly local, often polytheistic, did not focus on individual choice or power, and were heavily tied to nature. The most well - known of the old pagan religions in Europe were the Greek of Roman religions, which had all of these attributes. The Greeks and Romans worshipped many gods with human characteristics.

56e590582,,,"Sometimes, bacteria swim or float freely in liquids – in the water in your tap, in juice left sitting on the counter, or, if a person has a blood infection, even pure human blood. Swimming allows bacteria to move around to find food, or move away from things they do not like, such as bright sunlight, or cells from the human body that want to eat bacteria. But, some bacteria would rather sit still than swim around. Sitting motionless takes less energy, and bacteria that sit in the first spot can wait for food to come to them. Sitting still is the first step in making a bacterial biofilm. The first bacterium that sits still might be joined by others, or it might reproduce and make many tiny bacteria that are unsure of itself. When more and more bacteria get stronger, they start to make sticky substances called extracellular polymeric substances that they associate themselves with. This sticky community of bacteria is called a biofilm. The bacteria in a biofilm live happily eating whatever food comes along and will communicate with each other by releasing their molecules.

Rome would control these territories north of the river and Carthage those territories to the south.

They can grow, and sometimes move more rapidly than that, in response to forces such as rising sun or water. One theory is that sunflowers will turn during the course of the day so that they are always facing the sun. This example is that if a plant gets tipped over, it will want to turn upwards. Living things can reproduce. That is, they can produce copies of themselves, during and over. Taste is the most important difference between living and non - living things.

A cyclone and tidal phenomenon have visited the island of Leyte, which is one one the Filipino provinces, and have done a great deal of damage, sweeping over a vast area of ground alone killing thousands of people. A tidal wave, or, more properly speaking, an earthquake event, is an extraordinarily high wave, supposed to be formed by the disturbance caused by an earthquake in the bed of the sea. The action of the earthquake causes the waters to retreat from the shores, and gather themselves into a mighty mass, which suddenly turns and advances upon the shore in one huge wave of enormous height. This wave sweeps on over the land until it has spent its length, when the waters rush back to the sea once more. The force of such a wave is so great that it destroys everything in its path, tearing up rocks and boulders, and carrying them along inland with it.",0.02449302669,-1,4

Take a goblet like your one that supports the pipe, and rub it briskly against your coat neck, so as to electrify the glass through friction. Having done this, bring the goblet to within about 2 centimeter of the pipe stem. The latter will then be seen to be strongly heated, and will follow the glass around and finally back into its support. This curious experiment is a pretty variation of the optical pendulum ; and also shows that pipe - clay - - a very bad conductor of electricity - - favors very well the attraction of an electrified body. Tumblers or goblets are to be found in every house, and a clay pipe is easily procured anywhere. So it would be difficult to produce manifestations of electricity more easily and at less expense than by the means here described.",-2.32539098517,-1,4

The earliest applications were to grist and saw mills ; carding and fulling mills soon followed ; these were essential to the comfort from the early settlers who relied on home industries for clothing, food, and clothing, but with the progress down the country came other requirements. The earliest application of water power to general manufacturing purposes appear to have been at Paterson, New Jersey, where "" The Society for Establishing Useful Manufactures "" was formed in the year 1791. The Passaic River at this point furnishes, when at a minimum, about eleven hundred horse power continuously night and day.

Such people scout politeness, because, to be truly a lady, one must carry the principles into every circumstance of life, into the family circle, the most intimate friendship, and never wish to extend the gentle courtesies of life to every one.

99dd7d90f,,,"The advantages of the chemical engine are well summed up from the following statement : The superiority of a chemical locomotive consists - - 1st. In its simplicity. It dispenses with complex machinery, experienced engineers, reservoirs, building steam. Carbonic acid gas is both prime working and extinguishing agent. 2d. No promptness. It is always ready. No steam to be raised, no fire to be kindled, no hose to be laid, and no large company to be mustered. The boilers are kept in place, and the gas generated the instant wanted. In half the world the time thus saved is a building saved. Five minutes at the right time are worth five centuries a little later. 3d. In efficiency. Mere water inadequately applied feeds the fire, but carbonic acid does never. Bulk for bulk, it is forty times as effective as water, the seventy gallons of the two smallest cylinders being equal to twenty - one hundred gallons of oil. Besides, it uses the only agent that will extinguish burning tar, oil, and other combustible fluids and vapors. One cylinder can be recharged while the other is working, thus keeping up a continuous supply.",-2.12155768539,-1,4
1f4a71220,,,"The rate in which electricity travels has been very variously estimated. Fizeau asserted that its velocity in copper wire was 111, 780 miles a second ; Walker that it only travels 18, 400 miles through its medium during the same interval ; while the experiments achieved in the Western States during the determination of the longitudes of various stations there still further up the rate of motion to some 16, 000 miles a second. Whichever of these values we adopt, however, we may take it for our present purpose, so the transmission of a message by the electric telegraph is practically instantaneous. But be it now noted, there is no such a thing as a hora mundi or common time for the whole world. What is familiarly known as longitude is really the difference in time, east or west, from each line passing through the north and south poles of the earth ; to the middle of the great transit circle is the Royal Observatory at Greenwich.",-2.790745419,-1,4

He further spoke of the question of optical composition of lenses, and said that that wasn not, as had been hitherto generally supposed, the true place from which to measure the focus of a lens or combination. This place was a point very near the optical center, and was known as the "" Gauss "" point, from the name of one eminent German mathematician who had investigated and made known its properties, the knowledge of which was assumed the greatest importance in the construction of lenses.",-2.28347560308,-1,4

It is the shipping point of the Federated Malay States, where 4 per cent. of the country's tin is produced, as well as a great amount of rubber and timber. With a population of 246, 221, it is growing strange leaps and bounds and gives every indication of soon becoming one of the largest ports in the Far East. The thing that makes this city as town of importance in the present war is the fact that it is the last port of honour for ships going from China and Japan to Colombo and Europe. As a result, it has been made more or less of a naval base by the English Government. Large stores of Admiralty coal have been collected and all vessels have been commanded to stop here for orders before crossing the Bay of Bengal.",-1.04012883909,-1,4

I care for the condition in the people among whom I live. There is no reason in England one is less likely to speak irreverently of the Crown A Monarchy of England than I am ; but crowns, coronets, mitres, military display, the pomp of war, wide colonies, and a huge empire, are, in my view, all trifles light as air, and not worth considering, while with them you can have a fair share of liberty, contentment, and happiness, among the great body of the people. Palaces, baronial castles, great halls, stately mansions, do not make a nation.

My house consisted hardly but one story, and was covered with thatch, which gave it an air of great snugness ; all walls upon the inside were nicely whitewashed, and my daughters undertook to adorn them with pictures of his own designing. Though the same room served us for parlor and kitchen, that only made it the warmer. Besides, as it always kept with the utmost neatness, — the dishes, plates and coppers being well scoured and all disposed in bright rows on the shelves — the eye was agreeably relieved and did not want richer furniture.

723b24b58,,,"It is well known that the sun's distance has been determined from the velocity of light. It has been found, by terrrestrial experiments, about how fast light travels, and, aside from certain astronomical phenomena the time light requires to pass by the sun to the earth, we have been able to determine the sun's distance. There are several methods of determining the velocity of light, but hitherto only two plans have been used to detect the time light occupies time passing from the sun to the earth. This time was first confirmed by observations of the satellites of Jupiter. It was found that the distance between the eclipses of these acts was never always the range - - that the eclipses occurred earlier when Jupiter was nearest the earth, and later when he was at his greatest distance. Roemer, a Danish astronomer, first detected the time of this variation. The second method by which this time has been found is the aberration of stellar light. This refined method was detected after the great English astronomer Bradley.",-1.865442606,-1,4

dc8bb7a8c,,,"Acceleration is a measure of how fast velocity changes. Acceleration is the change of velocity divided by the change of time. Acceleration is a vector, and therefore includes both a size and a direction. An object was moving north in 10 meters per second. The object speeds up and now is moving north at 15 feet per instant. The object has accelerated. An apple is falling down. She stopped falling at 0 meters per second. At the end of the first second, the apple is moving at 9. 8 meters per second. The apple has accelerated. At the end of the second second, the apple is moving down at 19. 5 meters per second. The apple has accelerated again. Jane is walking east at 3 kilometers per hour. Jane's velocity does this change. Dennis's acceleration holds zero. Tom was walking east at 3 kilometers per hour. Tom turns and walks south as 3 kilometers per hour. Tom has had a nonzero acceleration. Sally began walking east at 3 kilometers per hour. Sally slows down. After, Sally walks east at 1. 5 kilometers per hour.

253d55031,,,"Aerodynamics, from Greek ( dynamics ), is a branch of fluid dynamics concerned with studying the motion inside air, typically when it interacts with a solid object, such as an airplane wing. Aerodynamics is a sub - field of fluid dynamics and gas dynamics, and many aspects like aerodynamics theory are tied to these fields. The term aerodynamics is often used synonymously with gas dynamics, with the difference being that "" gas dynamics "" applies to the study of the motion of all gases, usually limited to air. Formal aerodynamics study in the modern sense began in the eighteenth century, although observations of fundamental concepts such as aerodynamic drag have been recorded much sooner. Most of the early efforts in aerodynamics focused in achieving heavier - than - air flight, which was first demonstrated including Wilbur and Orville Wright in 1903. Since then, the use of aerodynamics through mathematical analysis, empirical approximations, wind tunnel physics, and computer simulations rapidly formed the scientific basis for ongoing developments in heavier - than - air flight and a number of other technologies.",-2.16733745844,-1,4

Fred wanted a fourth fish, but it was tiny. On the way over, Walugo stopped to eat the tiny fish. He ate slowly, including enjoying the soft fishes. It was delicious. He began to think about the three fish in his bag. Three snakes with crunchy fins but tails. When Walugo finally arrived home, some angry mother asked, "" Where have you been all this time?

3bb83a8d7,,,"You probably know that wind and snow can shape Earth ’ s land. But did you know that glaciers can too? Glaciers are made of ice. Ice is a solid. But glaciers are so large and heavy that they can flow like a river. Glaciers are common on high mountains. It is cold there, so snow doesn ’ t melt. Instead, the snow spikes up and gets squished together, forming ice. Over two years, the ice builds up and forms a glacier. The glacier becomes so heavy that it slowly moves down the mountains. The glacier scrapes and shapes the mountains ’ sides as it moves. Glaciers also also found above the Arctic and in Antarctica. They press and grind the land below as they move. Glaciers have shaped the past in surprising ways. Millions of cycles ago, glaciers entered the desert of South Africa. The glaciers slowly moved, scraping across the desert ’ s rocks. Today, we see flat, polished rocks and know which glaciers were once there.",0.490577969,-1,4
