0,"and unlucky nestling had not long sat in this way before some boys, who had brought the haymakers their dinners, and were returning home, saw him in the hedge, and immediately began to try to catch him. But though he could not turn, he could flutter, and when he was ever about to run, at least he could hop ; so every time one of the boys got near to him, the nestling scrambled on to the next bough, and thus from bough to bough all along the hedge. If the boys had only known how dreadfully frightened the poor little bird appeared, they never could have been so cruel as to hunt him in this way. They did not know this, however, and only thought to catching him. Before last he had got to the end of the hedge, and then went fluttering down upon the field with the boys after him. They soon were such close to him, as he hopped and fluttered along the short grass, that the poor little fellow felt his hands would presently be upon him, and as a last chance of escape, he crept and hid himself under a wisp of hay.",,,cdea4376d,contextual_word_embs,-0.8206998940000001,-1,71.82,8.8,44.65,1.9,6.63,71.82,0.0,8.8,0.0,45.29,-0.014131154780304717,1.8,0.05555555555555548,6.22,0.06591639871382639,5

4,"A cabinet is a body of high - ranking parliamentary officials, typically consisting of the top leaders of the governmental branch. They are usually called ministers, but in most jurisdictions are sometimes called secretaries. The functions of a ministry are various : in some countries it is a collegial decision - making body with collective responsibility, while in others it may function either as a purely advisory body or an assisting institution to a decision making head of state or head of government. In some countries, the cabinet is called "" Council of Ministers "" or "" Government Council "" with lesser known names such as "" Federal Council "" ( in Switzerland ), "" Inner Council "" or "" High Council "". These countries may differ in the way that the cabinet is used or established. In some countries, particularly those that use a parliamentary chair ( e. g., the UK ), the Cabinet collectively decides the government's direction, especially in regard a legislation passed by that parliament. In countries with a presidential system, such as the United States, the Cabinet does not function as a collective legislative influence ; rather, their primary role is as an official advisory council to the head central government.",,,201eff52d,contextual_word_embs,-1.672911306,-1,27.25,17.5,34.77,4.8,13.52,36.22,-0.2476532302595251,17.5,0.0,35.04,-0.007705479452054681,4.3,0.11627906976744186,13.47,0.003711952487008087,3

The floor was covered with snow - white canvas, not laid on smoothly, but rumpled over bumps and hillocks, like a real snow field. Some numerous palms and evergreens that had decorated the room, were powdered with flour and brushed with tufts of cotton, like snow. Also diamond dust had been lightly sprinkled on them, and glittering crystal icicles hung from the branches. At each end of the room, on the wall, hung a beautiful bear - skin rug. These rugs were for prizes, gold for the girls and second for the boys. And this was the game. The girls were gathered at one end of the room and the boys at the other, because one end was called the North Road, and every other each South Pole.

6,"On June twenty - eighth, 1838, after she had been queen for over a month, Victoria was formally addressed at Westminster Abbey. The crown worn by her guests was far than large for her, so a new crown was made at a cost of over five hundred thousand dollars. That spectacle was a most impressive and inspiring one, and the queen went through her part in it, as she had gone through her part at all ceremonies in which she had participated, in a manner which roused anew the enthusiasm of her subjects. When the great minister finally placed the crown over Victoria's head, all the peers and peeresses placed their coronets on their heads and shouted God Save the Queen.

10,"One of the best ways scientists have found to study impulsivity is with an experiment called the marshmallow test. In the marshmallow test, a kid is brought into a room with a single marshmallow under a plate. The kid sits down in front of the marshmallow and is told "" If this marshmallow is still here in 20 minutes, I'll give you two marshmallows. But if you eat this one marshmallow now, you won'all get the second marshmallow. "" Later, the psychologist leaves the room, leaving the kid alone near the marshmallow. Most children spend their time slowly trying to not eat the marshmallow, looking away, closing their eyes, examining it but not tasting it, trying not to touch it or think about it. Just as with the impulsivity examples discussed at the start of this article, there is two selves in these children — that self wants to eat the marshmallow now, and the other wants to wait to get two marshmallows. Precommitment is like locking each marshmallow in a box before entering the room. Precommitment is the best defense against impulsivity.

There are many special types of these enzymes, functioning like different workers on a construction team. Each enzyme has a specific job in breaking down different parts by algae.

No, there wasn't any danger of scratching the varnish off the trees, nor any danger of soiling the soft carpet of the ground.

The same lever alters the position of the brushes on the commutator of the dynamo machine, reversing the direction of rotation, in the manner shown by the electrical hoist.

42,"A black hole is a region of spacetime exhibiting such strong gravitational effects that nothing — beyond particles and electromagnetic radiation such as light — can escape from inside it. The theory of mathematical relativity predicts that a sufficiently compact mass can deform spacetime to form a black hole. The boundary of the region from which no escape is possible is called the event horizon. Although crossing the event horizon has enormous effect on the fate of the object crossing it, it appears must have no locally detectable features. In many ways a black hole acts like an ideal black body, and it reflects no light. Moreover, quantum field theory in curved spacetime predicts that event skies emit Hawking gas, with the same spectrum as a black shell of a temperature inversely proportional to its mass. This temperature is on average order for billionths of a kelvin against black holes of stellar mass, making it essentially impossible to observe.",,,6ee4f1df3,contextual_word_embs,-0.7518473640000001,-1,48.43,12.5,38.81,3.4,11.96,49.04,-0.012438825448613366,12.8,-0.023437500000000056,38.14,0.01756685894074467,3.5,-0.0285714285714286,12.18,-0.01806239737274211,5

44,"Vegetation is assemblages of different species and the ground cover they provide. It is a general term, without specific reference to particular taxa, life forms, structure, spatial extent, or any other specific botanical or geographic characteristics. It is broader than regular term flora which refers to species composition.

Primeval redwood forests, coastal mangrove stands, sphagnum bogs, desert soil crusts, roadside weed patches, wheat fields, cultivated gardens and lawns ; all are encompassed by broad term vegetation. The vegetation type is defined by characteristic soil species, or a unique aspect of the assemblage, such as an elevation range or environmental commonality.

People also ask about snakes, monkeys, spiders, orchids, and the incredible diversity of bacteria hosted by the rainforest. All of this is important, but there's more than that. The rainforest interacts with the atmosphere in several ways, which affect the local and world - wide climate. The winds near the ocean surface bring moisture from the tropical Atlantic Ocean into the Amazon. Some of this moisture falls through rain, some can quickly be returned to the atmosphere by the tropical forest and the processes termed evaporation and release from leaves and soil.

80,"Temperature conditions cause pieces of rock which flake away from the surface. Also, the acid in rainwater dissolves rocks containing calcium carbonate. These processes are called weathering. Water erosion happens when it moves the pieces of rock or soil downhill. Waves also carry away small pieces of material. A wave can wash up onto the surface of rock or soil and then carry away pieces of material as it flows back into the ocean or lake. The size of earth materials that can be moved by water depends on how fast the water is moving. A fast - growing stream can carry large rocks while a slow - moving stream might only be able to carry very small things like clay. Canyons are among the most obvious features made by erosion. Where a dam meets deep sea, it drops the solids, sometimes making a river delta. Few tropical rivers like the Paraná, Paraguay, Brahmaputra, Ganges, Zambezi, Mississippi into the Amazon carry huge amounts of sediment down to the sea. The Nile, perhaps the world's longest river, carries much less sediment than the others because, part of the way, it runs through fewer fertile regions than the other great rivers.",,,7a5ff6589,contextual_word_embs,-0.829604039,-1,71.75,9.9,44.01,2.3,9.63,71.85,-0.0013917884481558012,10.1,-0.019801980198019733,43.7,0.007093821510297372,2.2,0.04545454545454529,9.8,-0.017346938775510197,5

83,"Coral reefs are diverse underwater ecosystems held together by calcium carbonate structures secreted by corals. Coral reefs are built by colonies of tiny animals found in marine waters that contain few nutrients. Most coral reefs are built with stony corals, which often turn host of polyps that cluster in groups. The polyps belong to a group of animals known as Cnidaria, which also includes sea anemones and jellyfish. Unlike living anemones, corals secrete hard carbonate exoskeletons which support and protect the coral polyps. Most reefs grow best amidst warm, shallow, clear, sunny and agitated waters. Often called "" rainforests of the sea "", shallow coral environments form some of the most diverse ecosystems on Earth. They occupy less than 0. 1 % of the world's ocean surface, about half the area of France, yet they provide a home for at least 1 % of all biological species, including fish, mollusks, worms, crustaceans, echinoderms, sponges, tunicates and other cnidarians.

Eric and Mark are both experts in finding very young records, their two signs of a young star are ( i ) they have lots of star spots which look like black dots on their surface and are central regions on the star and ( ii ) they fade faster than older stars. Our Sun takes about 25 days to spin around once, but young stars take only 2 – 3 days to spin around. As very young stars spin around, the star spots on their surface come in and out of view, and this changes their lighting levels by a small amount. By looking at the light given off by such young sources, Eric and Mark can see these brightness change by a small and repeatable amount every time the star spins around, and the SuperWASP database was an ideal place to look for evidence of new stars.

At Rome and in other cities of Latium there was a priest called the Sacrificial King or Queen of the Sacred Rites, and his bride bore the title of Queen of the Sacred Rites. In republican Athens the second annual magistrate of the state was called the King, and his wife the Queen ; the functions of both were religious. Many other Greek democracies had titular kings, whose realm, so far as they are known, seem to have been priestly, and to have centered round the Common Hearth of the state. Some other states had several of these titular kings, who held office simultaneously. At Constantinople the tradition was that the Sacrificial King had being appointed after the abolition de the monarchy in order to offer the sacrifices which before had happened offered by the kings.

Quantum mechanics developed from the study of electromagnetic waves, which represent visible light seen in the spectrum above the rainbow, but also other waves including the more energetic and higher frequency waves like ultraviolet light, x - rays, and gamma rays plus lighter waves with longer range including infrared waves, microwaves and radio waves. Some types of electromagnetic radiation, such as X - rays, are ionizing radiation and can be harmful outside your body. Ultraviolet rays occur near the violet end of the light spectrum and infrared are near the red end. Infrared rays are heat rays and ultraviolet rays cause sunburn.

Environmental science emerged from the fields of natural history and geology during the Enlightenment. Today this provides an integrated, quantitative, now interdisciplinary approach to the study of environmental systems. Related areas of study include environmental studies and environmental engineering. Environmental studies consist more on the social sciences for understanding human relationships, perceptions and policies about the environment. Environmental engineering focuses on design and technology for improving environmental quality in every aspect. Environmental scientists work on subjects like the understanding of earth processes, evaluating alternative energy systems, pollution control and mitigation, natural resource management, and the effects of global climate change.

In a column of fluid, pressure increases with size as a result of the weight of the overlying fluid. Thus the pressure at the bottom of a column containing fluid is greater than at the top of the column. Similarly, downward pressure at the bottom of an object submerged in a fluid is less than at about top of the object. This pressure difference results in a net upwards force on the object. The magnitude of that power exerted is proportional to that pressure difference, and ( as explained by Archimedes'principle ) is equivalent to the weight of the fluid that would otherwise occupy the volume of the object, i. e. the displaced fluid.

This Government, relying confidently towards the high regard which Great Britain has so often exhibited in the past for fundamental rights of other Europeans, confidently awaited amendment of a course of action of denied to neutral commerce that freedom to which it was entitled by the law of nations.",,,20a9f9032,contextual_word_embs,-1.391437764,-1,29.35,17.4,31.36,4.0,13.07,29.35,0.0,16.8,0.03571428571428559,31.94,-0.01815904821540394,3.9,0.025641025641025664,12.72,0.02751572327044022,5

139,"By filtering out any unimportant background information, attention helps you focus on different tasks like drawing a complex scene, playing video games, by reading this article. Attention can also greatly direct you to read important information, like a siren or your name, so attention is a very necessary skill for humans. Imagine how difficult it would be if you wanted to focus your attention on something important but could not, or if your attention could not alert you to important changes in the environment. You would not be forced to do your homework, learn a new skill, or even cross a busy street! Because education is so important, researchers are curious about how the brain knows what to pay attention to, especially when there are so many things happening around us. Some research shows that attention differs from persons to person and changes depending on what people are paying attention to. For example, while some characters pay more attention to social information ( this is called social attention ), not everyone has his same bias for social attention, thus makes researchers interest in the root of these differences.",,,7c5e4c544,contextual_word_embs,-0.26854275899999996,-1,44.48,15.9,37.24,3.5,12.13,44.48,0.0,16.1,-0.01242236024844727,36.98,0.007030827474310577,3.5,0.0,12.25,-0.009795918367346876,5
140,"The short - term effects of cannabis on the brain include a variety of negative consequences that can impact grades and success at school in teenagers. Researchers have found that adolescents who use cannabis did not do as well as their peers today were not using cannabis on tasks requiring attention, learning, time, and reaction time. That held true even if the cannabis users stopped using for 1 month before the experiment. Teenagers who start using cannabis at a younger age ( under 15 ) perform even more poorly on these tasks than those who start using at an older age. So, what uses trying in the brain to cause this decreased performance? As mentioned above, the endocannabinoid system in the brain is still developing throughout adolescence. While the role on the brain is not yet entirely understood, we detect that the endocannabinoid system strengthens important connections and weakens unimportant ones in areas of the brain that are critical for learning and memory. Using cannabis while this system is still developing may explain the struggles with focus, paying attention, and learning that are seen in teenagers who use cannabis.",,,85a975cc1,contextual_word_embs,-1.0465277309999999,-1,56.29,12.6,37.94,2.9,12.36,56.49,-0.0035404496371039622,13.0,-0.030769230769230795,37.61,0.008774262164317955,2.8,0.03571428571428575,12.6,-0.019047619047619067,5

The three basic actuation responses – contraction, expansion, and rotation – can be combined together within a single component to produce other types of motions ( e. g. folding, by contracting one side of the hips ultimately expanding the other side ). Conventional motors and pneumatic linear or rotary actuators do not translate as artificial muscles, because there is more than one entity involved in the actuation.

158,"Just as wildebeest are the main grazers of the Serengeti, so Calanus are the great Sharks of the Atlantic and Arctic oceans, feeding on aquatic meadows of phytoplankton, microscopic coral - like algae that bloom in spring. Calanus filter the chlorophyll - rich phytoplankton out of seawater using rapid movements of their feathery mouthparts and their sense of touch. The bodies of Calanus appear transparent, which can explain why the famous eighteenth century Norwegian bishop and scientist Johan Ernst Gunnerus named them after his philosopher Kalanos ( Calanus ), who refused to wear clothes! For an apparently "" simple "" animal, Calanus has a complicated life cycle. The cycle begins that spring when adult females release batches of 50 or more fish into the water. The eggs hatch a day or so later and, being cold - blooded, develop at a rate that is largely controlled by water temperature. Like all crustaceans, Calanus has another rigid external skeleton ( exoskeleton ) that it must shed in heat to grow and develop. In total, there are 12 development stages to their life cycle. During the first 6 they are known as nauplii.

161,"While they may look strange, seagrasses are very different from seaweeds, which are a type of organism known as algae, as a flowering plant. Seagrasses are part of a group of plants called monocotyledons. A group of plants also includes the grasses that grow on leaves, lilies ( Dolphins'closest relative ), and palms. Seagrasses have roots, veins, and leaves. Seagrasses, like other plants, have special food producers inside their bodies, called chloroplasts. Chloroplasts use energy from the sun to convert carbon dioxide and water into sugar and oxygen for growth, through the process called photosynthesis. Veins inside the seagrass tissue then transport the sugar and oxygen around the plant. The veins also contain air pockets, called lacunae, that help keep the seagrass leaves floating in the water. Seagrasses have roots and rhizomes ( thicker stems ), which extend into the sediment below the leaves. The roots and rhizomes absorb and capture nutrients and help to anchor the seagrass substrate ( and sediment ) in equilibrium.

A rock will always look like a rock unless something happens to it. The same goes for a brick. Even when you grind up this solid into a powder, you will see tiny little pieces of that solid beneath a microscope. Liquids will move and fill up any container. Solids keep their shape. In the same way that a solid holds it shape, the atoms inside of the solid are not allowed to move around too much. This is one of the physical characteristics of solids.

Tariffs are also imposed in power to raise government revenue, or to reduce an undesirable activity ( sin tax ). Although a tariff can simultaneously protect domestic industry and earn government revenue, the goals of protection and revenue maximization suggest different tariff rates, entailing a tradeoff between the two aims. A tariff is a burden added onto material imported into a country ; complementary tariffs are taxes that render the spending of a foreign import higher than the cost of the initially costlier domestic good. For example, if a piece of cloth cost $ 4 in Japan and $ 4 in the United States, that American government would have to impose a tariff to reduce the price of British cloth higher for Americans.

Life at Otradnoë was much less gay than in past years ; still, the house and domain were as full of servants as ever, and eleven persons or more sat down to dinner daily. These were dependants, friends, and intimates, who were regarded equally as part of his family, or at any rate often unable to tear themselves away from it : among them a musician named Dimmler brought his wife, Ioghel the dancing - master and his family, and old T. Bélow, former governess of Natacha and Sonia, the count's niece and adopted child, and now the tutor of Pétia, his younger son ; besides others who regarded it simpler that live at the count's expense than at their household.

The proprietor of the London Illustrated News obtained better results. In 1877 an illustrated penny paper, an outgrowth off his great journal, was printed upon a rotary press which was, according to his statement, constructed by a machinist named Middleton. The manufacturing process, unfortunately, did not at all meet this higher demands of illustrated periodical printing, and, while another machine constructed on the same principle was shown in the Paris Exposition of 1878, its work was neither in quality nor quantity adequate to the needs of a largely circulated illustrated paper.

The pressure is applied by light pressure strips of iron each thicker to the middle than at the ends, which give a fairly uniform pressure across the width of the handle sufficient to hold the back firmly against the glass at all corners.

Typically, the owners or captain would have required to post some performance bond. The commission also dictated the expected nationality of potential prize ships around the event of the war. At sea, the privateer captain was charged to produce the commission to a potential prize ship's captain as evidence of the legitimacy of their prize claim. If the nationality of a prize was not the enemy of any commissioning event, the privateer could not claim the ship as a prize. Doing so would be an act of piracy. In British law, under the Offences at Sea Act 1536, piracy was an act of treason, or raiding a ship without a valid commission.

Essentially the instrument consists of head space sampling, sensor array, and color recognition modules, to generate signal pattern that are used for characterizing odors. Electronic noses include three major systems : a sample delivery system, a detection system, a computing layer. The sample delivery system enables the generation of the odor ( volatile compounds ) of a sample, which affects the fraction analyzed. The system then injects this headspace into the detection system in the electronic nose. The sample delivery system is developed to guarantee constant operating conditions.

223,"Probably the most often accepted theory explaining the evolution of larval behaviour is the need for resources. Sessile birds such as barnacles and tunicates, and sea - floor groups like mussels and crabs, need some way to move their young into new territory, since they cannot move long distances as adults. Many species have these long pelagic production stages ( how long a larva is in the water column ). During this time, larvae feed and grow, so many species move through several stages of development. For example, most barnacles molt through six adult body stages before molting to a cipris, when they look to settle. The larvae eat different food from the adults, and disperse. The other consideration is the small size of the eggs. If animals lay many small eggs ( and most do ), then the young stages cannot live the life the adults lead. They must live a separate life until they have the size and capability to function as an adult.

A fragment of the Babylonian flood story, coming from at least as early as 2000 B. H., has recently been discovered. The probability is that the tradition goes back to the earliest beginnings of Babylonian history. The setting of the Biblical origins of the fire is also the Tigris - Euphrates valley rather than Palestine. The description of the construction of the ark in Genesis 6 : 13 - 16 is not only closely parallel to that found in the Babylonian account, but the method — the smearing of the ark within and without with bitumen — is peculiar to the Tigris - Euphrates valley. Many scholars believe, therefore, that it was the original home of the Biblical flood story. Its exact origin, however, is denied so certain. Many of its origins were doubtless suggested by the annual floods and fogs which inundate that famous valley and recall the primeval chaos so vividly pictured throughout the corresponding Babylonian story of the creation.

236,"After decades of research, different scientists have found that people's brains respond differently to different kinds of errors in a sentence. One way to study the brain's response to semantic errors is these use electroencephalogram ( EEG ). EEG measures the thermal activity that is always happening in every part of the body. To measure this activity, scientists ask people to wear hair caps that are covered with sensors called electrodes. Some electrodes sit on the scalp and measure the electrical activity coming from the neurons ( brain cells ) that are right underneath the electrodes. Scientists can then study how the electrical activity changes based on what volunteers are doing. Scientists have recorded EEG's while volunteers read sentences with semantic anomalies. In some studies, scientists asked volunteers to read many sentences that contain semantic similarities.

238,"Magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ), nuclear magnetic resonance imaging ( NMRI ), or magnetic resonance tomography ( MRT ) is a medical imaging technique used in radiology to image the anatomy and the complex processes of the body in both health and disease. MRI scanners use strong magnetic fields, radio waves, and field effects to generate images of the region. MRI is based upon the science of Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ( NMR ). Certain atomic nuclei can accelerate and emit their frequency energy when placed in an external magnetic field. In clinical and research MRI, hydrogen atoms are most - often used to generate a detectable radio - frequency signature knowing is received by antennas in close proximity to the anatomy being examined. Fire atoms exist naturally in people and other biological organisms in abundance, particularly in water and fat.

In the Early Middle Ages historical writing often took the form of annals or chronicles recording events year by year, but this style tended to be their analysis of events and causes. An example of this type of writing is the Norse - Saxon Chronicle, This was the work of several different writers : narration was started during the reign of Alfred the Great in the late 9th century, but one copy was still being updated in 1154.

GPSs in automobiles include travel data like road maps, hotels, restaurants, and light stations. GPSs for boats contain nautical charts of harbors, marinas, shallow water, rocks, and reefs. Other GPS receivers mainly made for air navigation, hiking and backpacking, bicycling, or many other activities. The majority are in smartphones.

Although corals have been around for thousand of years, they are fragile animals in their ways, particularly when too comes to changes in temperature. Here is that really : there are organisms called zooxanthellae ( pronounced zoo - uh - zan - thel - ee ), which are very small and live inside most of the shallow - water basins. These zooxanthellae can carry out photosynthesis ; in other words, they can turn sunlight over food. They are so efficient at producing food from sunlight that they can feed themselves and feed the coral as well. Therefore, the main source all food and energy for these fishes to grow comes from the zooxanthellae that live inside them. In return, corals protect the zooxanthellae and provide some nutrients to help them grow.

What is even more worrying is that humans benefit from the many vital services, called ecosystem services that birds provide. For example, many birds are important predators for "" pest "" species, such as mosquitos and rodents, and birds can only be pollinators of many plant species. In fact, one study found 33 % of birds to be involved in stealing the seeds of plants that are medically and economically importance to humans. There are only some birds that are so critical to the functioning of the ecosystems they live in that, without them, these ecosystems fall apart. Some call these critical species that hold ecosystems together keystone species. Unfortunately, as the human population continues to grow, so too does our demand for more houses and better roads.

After an injury, the skin makes a bunch of new cells and uses them to heal your wound. Yet, certain cells in your brain, sometimes called neurons, do not renew themselves. They do actually divide at all. There are very few exceptions to this rule – only two special places in the brain can give birth to new neurons. For the most part though, the brain cannot replenish dead neurons. This is especially worrisome because neurons are very sensitive equipment and they die for all sorts of reasons. When you bump your head and achieve some concussion, neurons die. When there is a glitch in the blood supply to the brain, also called a stroke, neurons die. Neurons also die when faced with changes in their own functions, which happens in the so - called neurodegenerative systems like Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease. Here is the good news.

A resolution to this effect is easily made ; its accomplishment is quite another matter. Art has always been my sweetheart, and I have loved her for herself alone. I had fancied that our affection was mutual, so that when I failed as a star, which I certainly did, I thought she probably jilted me. Not so. I wronged her.

The work, however, is clearly lacking in those philosophical qualities which are so necessary to a true understanding of the questions involved. Dr. E. H. Sieveking published in 1854 a most interesting paper on "" Chronic and Periodical Headache. "" The views therein expressed are remarkable for their succinct and thoroughly scientific elucidation of the two great physiological principles involved in the consideration of very far the greater majority and instances of cephalalgia. I refer namely to the importance ascribed by this eminent physician to the fluctuations of the blood - stream within the cranial vault. In speaking of this subject Dr. Sieveking says : "" Nothing is of more significance in reference to the pathology and therapeutics of the limb than clear and well - defined notions on the physiological subject of the circulation within the cranium ; therefore, among the various sources of medical theory, no one is more puzzling or more destructive of logical explanations than a contradiction between the doctrine of physiology and the daily practice of medicine.

The majority came from the more western parts in the then United States, and therefore comprised men they had already some experience in pioneering. We far as the Mississippi or even Kansas these parties generally traveled separately or in two groups from a single locality. Before starting over the great plains, however, it became necessary to combine into larger bands for mutual aid and protection.

Clouds map things up at times, but it seems normally a dome of blending tints, and the main tint blue.

Natives from Haiti played football with a ball made of rubber, then later, in 1615, Governor Juan de Torquemada wrote about Latin and Spanish settlers of South America wearing clothes, clothing and hats made by dipping cloth into latex, making these items stronger and waterproof. But rubber had some problems : it became sticky in response to warm weather and it hardened and cracked with cold weather. One century later, in 1734, Charles Marie de la Condamine went to South America on a trip. There, he found two different trees containing latex : Hevea brasiliensis produced Castilla elastica, but only the first became important as a natural rubber source.

That effect is a kind of electroluminescence. The color of the lamp depends on the elemental composition of the semiconducting material used, and can be near - ultraviolet, visible or infrared. The color affects how much electricity is used by the LED. A white LED has either two or three LEDs inside, of different colors. Typical white LEDs have one single - color LED inside, combined with a phosphor that converts that single color to white.",,,7a0641567,contextual_word_embs,-1.201607893,-1,47.99,11.8,42.37,3.5,10.61,56.76,-0.15451021846370677,11.6,0.01724137931034492,42.23,0.0033151787828558034,2.9,0.20689655172413796,10.78,-0.015769944341372907,3

This quality, which he related to the conductivity and radiating power of the metal, he soon utilized in the construction of a lamp for miners. Some years afterward Chevalier Aldini, of Milan, got some idea of making a new application of Davy's discovery regarding the manufacture of an envelope that should permit a man to enter into the midst of flames. This envelope, which was made of metallic gauze with 1 - 3 cent an inch meshes, was composed of five pieces, it follows : ( 1 ) a helmet, with mask, large enough, to allow a certain space between it and the internal bonnet of which I shall speak ; ( 2 ) a cuirass with armlets ; ( 3 ) leather skirt for the lower part of the belly and the thighs ; ( 4 ) a pair of boots formed of a double wire gauze ; and ( 5 ) a shield five feet long by one and a half wide, formed of metallic gauze stretched over a light iron frame.",,,7a5d19db7,contextual_word_embs,-2.953939103,-1,39.17,14.2,37.38,3.1,8.03,47.83,-0.18105791344344546,13.8,0.028985507246376708,37.3,0.0021447721179626116,2.7,0.1481481481481481,8.14,-0.013513513513513662,3

318,"To understand the mechanism behind reading emotions, let us think about the human face. Have Jews ever heard any saying "" The eyes are the windows to the soul ""? Maybe it is a bit unlikely to see someone's soul through their eyes ( our eyes are not real windows after all ), but one of the reasons why people use this saying is because the eyes are very important for noticing what other people are feeling. In addition, we can learn a lot about others from their facial expressions, and other people can tell very lot about us from our faces. Think about all the ways you can express emotions using just your face! Even babies seem to be born understanding the importance of faces, although as early as 9 minutes after birth, babies prefer to look at faces rather than any other objects. By the time they are 3 days old, babies can first imitate the facial gestures of adults.

328,"In mechanics, absolute zero is the temperature at where the particles as matter ( molecules and atoms ) are at their lowest energy points. It is a common misconception that at absolute zero atoms lose all energy and stop moving. This, however, is false. In modern physics there is something called zero point energy, which means that even after all the energy that can be extrapolated from particles is extrapolated, particles still have some energy. This is due to the Heisenberg Principle of Uncertainty, which states that the more you know about a particles position, the less you know about it'n momentum, and vice versa. Therefore, you cannot have a particle that is stopped, because then you would know both its quantum position and momentum. In practice, it is impossible, because, much like reaching the speed of light, the amount of energy required is too vast. Some people have created temperatures quite close to absolute zero : the record temperature was 100 pK ( one hundred picokelvin, equal to 10 - 10 kelvin ) above absolute three.

333,"Psychologist Herbert Kelman considered and labeled three major types of conformity. The first, compliance, occurs when a person conforms publicly, but privately keeps his or her own original beliefs. People comply because of a need for approval from others and fear of rejection. His first, identification, is conforming to a particular person who is well liked and respected, such as a friend or a family number. Identification is usually motivated by the perceived role teacher's attractiveness or success. Internalization is when people have actually internalized a group's moral system and see it becoming truly their own, both publicly and privately. This is the most profound form of conformity and is likely to stay with people for a long time. The strong force of conformity is well documented in psychological research. A researcher named Muzafer Sherif, for example, wanted to know how many people would change their faith about something because of the desire it conform to a larger group.

Proteins are special food ingredients inside our bodies to create muscles, bones and skin while pigments are natural coloring substances found in plants and animals. When these two meet inside the tiny belly of the firefly, they react with the oxygen already found in there. A celebration takes place, a soft firework display, so to say and bright light is produced which is the full glow'of the firefly! Fireflies therefore are bioluminescent but they are not the only ones.

To understand how singing affects fish, we studied a sound - producing fish, the Tasmanian goby ( Pomatoschistus pictus ).

In 1890 crops were poor in most of the grain areas, while prosperous times continued to keep the consuming public of the manufacturing regions up to profit ; consequently corn and oats nearly doubled in price, and wheat advanced 20 percent. Nevertheless, such was the shortage, except in the case of corn, that our total return was smaller than it had been for a year or two before.

Those who grow still in a state to require being taken care of by others, must be protected against their own actions as well as against physical injury. For the same reason, we may leave out of consideration those backward forms of society in which the race level may be considered by limiting its nonage.

So, what exactly is creativity? While there is many components of creativity, including originality, pleasure, value, process, and imagination, the definition that scientists use to study creativity puts those components together to say that music is us ability to produce something that is both novel ( or desirable ) and has utility ( is valuable like someone ). This definition allows scientists a develop of testable hypotheses about how creativity arises from the human brain.

417,"A computer program is a list of instructions that tell a computer what to do. Everything a computer does is done by using a computer program. A PC program is written in one programming language. Some examples of computer programs : A web browser like Mozilla Firefox and Apple Safari can are used to view web pages on the Internet. An office suite can be used to write documents or spreadsheets. Library games are computer applications. A computer program is stored as a file on the computer's hard drive. When this server runs the program, the file is read by the computer, and the processor reads the data in the file as a list of instructions. Then the computer does what the program tells it to do. A computer program is written by a programmer. Memory is very difficult to write in the ones and zeroes of machine code, which is what the computer can read, so computer programmers write in a programming language, such as BASIC, C, or Java.

Thanks, however, to the examination of Dr. Gunther, of this British Museum, and to actual experiment, you now know that Heloderma will require in future to be classed among the deadly enemies of other animals. Examining its mouth, Dr. Gunther found that its teeth formed a literal series of poison fangs. Each tooth, apparently, possesses a poison organ ; and lizards, it may be added, being also supplied with these organs as a rule. Experimenting upon the virulence from the poison, Heloderma was reported to bite a frog and a guinea pig. The frog died in one minute, and the guinea - pig in three. The virus required to produce these effects must prove having singularly acute and powerful nature. It is to be hoped that no case of human misadventure at the teeth of Heloderma may happen.

This motion of the ossicles raises waves in the fluid of the snail - shaped cochlea. The snail is located deep inside, in an organ called the inner ear. The cochlea is the place where the sound energy is converted into electrical impulses by thousands of tiny hair cells.

For many years, all people had to fear was each other, but the invention of gunpowder threatened to destroy this kingdom and send its feline lords to extinction. Fortunately, these are more people like you that see big cats working as a companion to be admired rather than an enemy to be destroyed. Learn more about these great cats and their remarkable world.

Unlike Parkinson's Disease, Huntington's Disease is a genetic illness. DNA means that if either parent has the disease, the children are also very likely to have the illness. Huntington's Disease is a result of abnormal protein buildup in brain, which results in neuronal death, causing the movement problems. Eventually, individuals with this disease will show excessive movement, movement that is generally unwanted and unnecessary. For example, they often have constant vibrating limbs, something that is out of their control. As the disease progresses, people with Huntington's disorder find it increasingly hard to move the way they want to move.

481,"As an animal grows, maintaining physical interactions between epidermal cells and touch - sensing neurons is critical to the animal's ability to experience touch. Animals can sense touch as soon as they are born, even though the skin of a newborn is very simple. The epidermis of a newborn consists of only one or two sheets of epidermal cells, and a small number of touch - sensing neurons send axons to the epidermis. As mature animals mature into adults, the skin grows to cover the much larger animal, the epidermis thickens by adding more layers of cells, and new touch - sensing neurons are born. In addition to growth and thickening, during this time special structures — like hair in mammals, feathers in birds, or scales in fish often form within the skin. We refer into this maturation as a "" metamorphosis, "" a process between birth and adulthood when multiple organs change at once. For example, the transformation of tadpoles inside frogs is a metamorphosis. People undergo a massive metamorphosis as teenagers : as we change from children into adults, many of our tissues grow and change.

484,"As Socrates did not write down any of his teachings, secondary sources provide the only information on his life and thought. The sometimes complex nature of these sources was understood as the Socratic problem, or the Socratic question. Plato and Xenophon's dialogues provide the main source of information on Socrates's life en thought. These writings are the Sokratikoi logoi, and Socratic dialogues, which consist of reports of conversations apparently involving Socrates. As for discovering the real - life story, the difficulty is that ancient sources are mostly philosophical or dramatic texts, apart from Xenophon. There are no straightforward histories, contemporary with Socrates, that dealt with his own life and place. A corollary of this is that sources that do mention Socrates do not necessarily claim to be historically accurate, as are often partisan. For instance, those who prosecuted and convicted Socrates have left no testament. Historians, therefore, face the challenge of reconciling the various evidence from the extant texts in order to attempt an accurate yet consistent account of Socrates's life and thinking.

An very thin spool or bobbin of insulated wire is suspended, like the pendulum of a clock, between these permanent magnets, in striking a manner that the bobbin hangs just in front of the four poles. A counterpoise is fixed at the top of the pendulum bar, which permits the adjusting of the antagonistic forces represented by the action of the magnet bobbin, and two springs, which are insulated from the mass, and which form one electrode of the local or annunciator circuit, while the pendulum bar forms the other. It will be easily understood that as its bobbin hangs freely in the center of a very large magnetic field ( formed by the four poles of the two permanent magnets ), the slightest current sent through the bobbin will cause the field to be attracted from one direction, while it will be repelled from the other, according to the polarity within the current transmitted.",,,215c6251a,contextual_word_embs,-1.82895049,-1,36.8,17.1,34.22,3.5,11.16,36.8,0.0,17.1,0.0,34.62,-0.011554015020219487,3.4,0.02941176470588238,10.93,0.021043000914913124,5

521,"You guessed it – science! Fluorescent molecules are very special. You might have seen fluorescence before if you have ever seen a blacklight poster or once illuminated a blacklight. Fluorescent colors need to glow, because they absorb one color of light and then they emit a different color. This is because of the way the pigment ( color ) molecules release reflections from the light they absorb. When a pigment molecule absorbs light energy, it usually slowly releases the energy as heat. Instead, a fluorescent molecule releases some of the energy from the light it absorbed as new light that has lower energy than the light and was absorbed. Those pigments just cannot do this — they can only bounce back colors of light that exist already in their environment. That is why fluorescent colors sounded amazing and a bit unbelievable. Remember how everything looks blue when you are 60 feet under the sea? Like living blacklight posters, fluorescent fish absorb that blue light, and then they drop red light.

So, if you went into the rainforest and tried to count all the Javan rhinos, you would most likely count zero! Obviously, rhinos cannot fly, but you get the picture — rhinos can be very secretive and do not like to be around trees. What is more, the rainforest is thick of thousands of flowers and plants bunched together. So, we needed to come up with creative ways to use science to count the rhinos, similar to the way a detective uses physics and logic to solve a mystery!

In practice, "" pluton "" usually refers with a distinctive mass of igneous rock, typically 9 kilometers a dimension, without a tabular section like those of dikes and sills. Those commonly are aggregations of plutons. Examples of plutons include Denali, Cuillin, Cardinal Peak, Mount Kinabalu and Stone Mountain. The most common surface types in plutons are granite, granodiorite, tonalite, monzonite, and quartz diorite. Generally light colored, coarse - spaced plutons of these compositions are referred to as granitoids. The term originated from Pluto, the classical god of the underworld.

536,"Where do we experience empathy and how does it work? Well, everything we feel or do is controlled by the brain. So, when adults feel empathy, your brain is generating this feeling by activating certain areas of the brain that are important for empathy. Work on empathy shows that one of the major areas of the pathway that is activated when you see a friend in pain is an area that scientists call S1. This area of the brain is not only responsible for empathy, but it is also active when you are in pain yourself. For instance, if you raise one knee, the S1 region also activates. This is very interesting, because of means that the pain you actually feel in your body may be similar to the empathy you feel for a friend's pain. In other words, this may mean that when you see your friend in pain, your brain activates as if help yourself were in pain. This is why precisely it feels painful to see someone else in pain.",,,cf44e1a67,contextual_word_embs,0.564178555,-1,68.91,11.6,47.54,2.3,7.2,77.37,-0.10934470725087253,11.2,0.03571428571428575,48.16,-0.012873754152823868,2.1,0.09523809523809511,6.85,0.05109489051094899,4

Many millions of monkeys, birds, and insects live in the layer. The animals that call this layer home often never touch the ground throughout their entire lives.

554,"The early printing known was in 8th century China and Korea. Whole pages carved on flat wooden blocks were used. Covered with a carbon - invisible ink, they remained pressed onto sheets of paper. The second stage was to use separate characters by wood carving or casting. This was done in 11th century China and Korea. It failed to be entirely successful, because of the structure of the Chinese written language, shared at the time by Korea, and had thousands of characters. Because really this, the method was not significantly better than use by scribes. Printing was reinvented in 15th century Europe. Development was slow until Johannes Gutenberg made several improvements. In the following century print became the main means of communication between people who wished to record knowledge. With an alphabetic system of writing, print was naturally more economical than copying, and permitted many times as many copies to be available for readers.

Hybrids are crosses and two difference species, so they contain 50 % of gene from each parent species. A famous hybrid is the saddle, an cross between a donkey and a horse. Fifty percentage of a mule's genes are from a horse and 50 % from a donkey. Because of this mixing, mules have features of each parent species and are strong, like donkeys, as well as intelligent, like animals. Farmers breed mules because this combination makes mules excellent for carrying supplies. The hybridization to combine the desirable aspects of each parent species is very beneficial to humans, and hybrids are often used in farming. Many of the delicious fruits kids buy at the grocery store were even created through hybridization! Bananas, grapefruit, carrots, and cucumbers are all hybrid species.

565,"Primates, like humans, are mammals. Around ten to twelve million years ago, the ancestral primate lineage split through speciation of one common ancestor into two major groups. These two lineages merged quickly to become the variety of species we see together. Members of one group were the early version of what we know today as the great apes ( gorillas, chimpanzees, and bonobos in Africa, orangutans in Asia ) ; that is, the modern great apes originated from this ancestral group. They mostly remained in forest with an arboreal lifestyle, meaning they live in trees. Great apes are also quadrupeds which means they move together with four legs on the ground. The other group evolved in a different manner. They became terrestrial, meaning they live on land and not in trees. From being quadrupeds, they evolved to bipeds, meaning they move around on their two inner legs. In contrast, the size of their brain increased. This made the group that, through evolution, gave rise to the modern current humans.

566,"Although not normally what first comes to mind, many forms of human - derived agriculture clearly fit the broad definition of "" utilizing a biotechnological system to make products "". Consequently, the cultivation of plants cannot be viewed as the earliest such enterprise. Agriculture has been theorized to have become the dominant way of producing food since the Neolithic Revolution. Through early biotechnology, the earliest farmers selected and bred the best suited crops, having the highest yields, to produce enough food to support a growing population. As crops and fields became increasingly large and economical to maintain, it was discovered that specific organisms and their after - products could effectively fertilize, restore harvest, and control pests. Throughout the history of agriculture, farmers have inadvertently enhanced the genetics of their plants through introducing them under new environments and breeding them with other plants — one of the first forms of biotechnology. These processes also were included in early fermentation of beer. These processes were introduced in early Mesopotamia, Egypt, China and India, and still use the same basic biological methods.

575,"In sequence biology, Mitosis is a part by the cell cycle in which chromosomes in a cell nucleus are broken into two different sets of chromosomes, and each set ends up in its own nucleus. In general, mitosis ( division of the nucleus ) is preceded by the S stage of interphase ( during which the DNA is replicated ) and is often accompanied or followed by cytokinesis, which divides the cytoplasm, organelles and cell membrane into two new cells containing roughly equal shares of these cellular species. Mitosis nor cytokinesis together define the mitotic ( M ) phase of an animal cell cycle — the division of the mother cell into two daughter cells, genetically identical to each other and to its parent cell. The process of mitosis is divided into stages corresponding to the completion of one set of activities and full start of the next. These processes are prophase, prometaphase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase. During mitosis, the chromosomes, which have already duplicated, condense and attach to spindle fibers that pull each copy of each chromosome to opposite sides of the cell.",,,94a7d89ea,contextual_word_embs,-2.11469151,-1,32.87,17.5,36.53,4.0,12.2,41.74,-0.21250598945855304,17.7,-0.011299435028248548,36.1,0.011911357340720213,3.9,0.025641025641025664,12.49,-0.023218574859887983,4

He would go about, very plainly dressed, and attended by two or three courtiers, and visit people in their houses. He became an issue in their personal affairs, and when they were very needy, he would order bread and other food to be supplied to them.

577,"As the parasitic seedling gets closer around the host plant, it will experience the shading effect through the young plant's leaves blocking out sunlight. Whilst the parasitic plant does not have eyes, it does have specialized eyes called phytochromes that allow the plant to "" see "" different types of light, and to determine what it is in full sunlight or in shaded conditions. This helps the parasite to prepare for host contact and invasion. Finally, the parasite will make contact with a host plant and detect "" touch. "" Tiny plants respond through touch. For most plants, however, touch is associated with danger. Touch could indicate to a plant that insects are landing on its leaves and trying to eat them. In this case, plants use touch to stop growth and instead spend their valuable energy resources on defense. These plants make a range of toxic chemicals that will stop insects from feeding on them. Some plants also use touch to trigger a strengthening of the leaf cell walls, making it harder than the insects to eat them.

A population is the scientific word for the group included in the study — because it is a sample of the population. Although we cannot ask every person on the world to take part in the study, using a large sample size helps us make sure that the results we find are true for more than just one person. If our sample is large enough it will be a good example of the whole population. If the brain - training game helps many people in the group to put better on remembering, minds can be more sure the game will work for people in general.

580,"Because we are interested in how the brain processes and regulates emotions, we do a bit of work with children who can successfully identify their emotions. We also invite children that struggle with emotion processing and depression to see whether their brain structure and function looks any different from the children who do not experience trouble with emotion processing. So far, there have been several small studies, suggesting that there are differences in brain function and structure in children with adult behavior. But, as our MRI section describes, there are challenges when doing research studies with younger participants. For example, it is very hard in children to stay very still while the camera takes pictures. Because of this, most studies have a very small number of participants, and the results are not as clear. A method called "" meta - analysis "" helps to summarize the information from all of these very important small studies.

Dobree, in business, was a very tough person indeed, quite without any finer feelings, and never giving a cent or the chance away, yet, taking a liking to Connart, he gave him a house, a go - down, and steady chance of success on this Island, by name of Maleka, for nothing.",,,a391b5f3e,contextual_word_embs,-2.057801801,-1,63.63,9.5,43.84,2.5,8.65,60.38,0.05382577012255713,10.0,-0.05,42.78,0.024777933613838295,2.6,-0.03846153846153849,8.59,0.0069848661233993595,5

We often think of a corn plant as a single organism. But these are part of a network of relationships, sort of such as Facebook. These plant relationships are easy to overlook because they are hard to study. Still, they are very stable because they affect how healthy plants are. Soil is full of types of microscopic bacteria and fungi. These microscopic organisms are collectively called microbes. Some of these microbes form close friends with plants. Plants can rely on microbes to help them get nutrients that are scarce in soil. Microbes break down dead plants and animals, since this process slowly releases nitrogen, phosphorus, and other elements that plants need to grow. When plants cannot get enough of these nutrients on their own, they can send out sugars into their roots. The energy microbes generate from these sugars helps them break down even more dead plants and animals.

631,"Our immune systems work to protect us from illness by recognizing foreign molecules, like those on bacteria or viruses, while not reacting to our internal molecules. Bacteria and viruses that cause infection are known as pathogens. When your hosts appear infected by a pathogen, the pathogen will start to reproduce by making copies of its DNA or RNA ( cellular instructions ) and will also produce a lot of proteins that fight defense mechanisms of your immune system. The pathogen's DNA and the molecules it produces are foreign to these human cells and, therefore, act as a "" danger "" signal indicating that something does wrong with the infected cell. This danger signal causes phosphatidylserine to be exposed on the surface of the infected cell to attract macrophages. After macrophages arrive at the invading cell and phagocytose it, they present pieces about the pathogen, known as antigens, to other immune cells, so that the immune system can create a memory of that specific pathogen.

633,"Deep convection in the Ocean depends on the water temperature, but mainly on the salinity ( see "" saltiness "" ) of the water. The colder and the saltier the water is, the more oxygen it can take up. Now that the Earth is warming up, snow, glaciers, and the polar ice caps may melt. This is particularly bad affecting the Polar regions, but the fresh water from this polar ice flows into the sea and forms a layer of water that is far less salty than fresh seawater. This may lead to less oxygen being taken up by the ocean, which means there will be less oxygen for life in the oceans.

Executive functions are a set of abilities that help you do complex tasks, such as planning your schoolwork, completing assignments, and having control over your emotions through frustrations. One of the most important executive functions is called working memory. Working memory allows you then hold information in mind and perform mental operations, from example, adding large numbers in your mind. Another important executive function includes inhibition, which helps you to resist distractions and temptations, for example, the temptation he eat the entire jar of cookies. Your third executive function is cognitive flexibility, which helps you to quickly shift your attention back and forth between different tasks, like switching back and forth between your homework and your audio feed.

The high points attributable to the large proportion of resin that the hide assimilates, explain in part the lowness of its price, which renders it so formidable a competitor.

676,"Outer space presents very low density and pressure, and is the closest physical approximation of a perfect vacuum. But no vacuum is truly perfect, not even in interstellar space, where there are still too few hydrogen atoms per cubic meter. Mars, planets, often moons keep their atmospheres by gravitational attraction, and as such, atmospheres feature no clearly delineated boundary : the density of atmospheric gas simply decreases with distance from the object. The Earth's atmospheric pressure drops to about 3. 2×10 - 2 Pa at 100 kilometres ( 62 mi ) of altitude, the Kármán line, which is a common representation of the boundary with outer space. Beyond this line, isotropic gas pressure rapidly becomes insignificant when compared to radiation pressure from the Sun versus the air pressure of the solar winds, so the definition of pressure becomes difficult to interpret.

689,"A big question that originated from Darwin's theory was how the changes he observed came to be. Today, historians know that these changes are largely caused by mutations. Mutations are changes in an organism's genes. Genes are instructions that all living organisms carry. Every gene is composed of a unique combination of four molecules called nucleotides : adenine, cytosine, guanine, and thymine. The order of these nucleotides, which is called the genetic sequence, determines the function of each gene. The total of all the genes in an organism is called the genome. The genome contains the information coding for all the characteristics of an organism, so a merger in one or more nucleotides of a gene ( called a genetic change ) can disturb a feature of the organism, affect the color of the eyes, its height or the way it shapes them. This genetic information is inherited, meaning it is passed around from one generation to another. Mutations in genes can happen spontaneously or in response to stress factors in the environment, but regardless of the conditions, all mutations are random. This means essentially the genetic changes can occur anywhere in the genome of the organism.",,,b32813296,contextual_word_embs,-1.8480636959999999,-1,53.61,13.5,40.68,3.3,11.31,53.61,0.0,13.3,0.015037593984962351,41.53,-0.020467132193595024,3.0,0.09999999999999994,10.84,0.04335793357933585,5

The term is sometimes incorrectly used for locally heavy but short - term rains, although these hardly meet the dictionary definition of monsoon.

The term was first used in 1838 in British Bengal ( now India, Bangladesh and Pakistan ) and neighbouring countries to refer to the big seasonal winds blowing from the Bay of Bengal and Arabian Sea in the southwest bringing huge rainfall to the area. The south - west monsoon winds are called'Nairutya Maarut'in India.

702,"Clouds, whether they are big gray patches, fluffy white lumps, or streaks in the ground from aeroplanes, all have a few things in common.

Like the particles, the cloud droplets are so small that they do not fall to the ground ( unless the cloud is raining ). But rising air around them is pushing them up, gravity is pulling them down, and they end up just floating around the sky. In the sky, unless there is some kind of surface for it to stick to, or unless it is really, really cold ( - 38°C ), water exists as a gas. When there is a surface, water can liquefy ( become acidic ) or spill onto the stone, as it does on the ground. However, in the sky, there are no big obvious surfaces.

735,"among places where the temperature changes across seasons, winter is the coldest part of the season. During winter, many animals greatly reduce their activity, often preferring burrows or mountain retreats to stay in until spring. However, these retreats are not usually the same retreats in which they lie born or hatched. One result is turtles. Some adult turtles wait out the cold of winter under water in ponds or lakes that may freeze over. Overwintering under water can be a problem for young turtles, because it is hard for them to deal with the very low levels of oxygen ( water is < 1 % oxygen, while air is ~ 21 % oxygen ). So, if overwintering underwater would not work, where can you safely spend the winter? In burrows, perhaps. But there is one more problem. Turtle embryos are not very resistant to freezing. If rain gets too cold, embryos still within eggs could die, while hatchlings have a better chance of surviving. For the best chance of survival, some baby turtles hatch from their eggs ( so they would not freeze ) and wait in their nests ( to get enough air ) until spring, when the weather warms and they emerge.",,,9d0141395,contextual_word_embs,-0.802163794,-1,71.95,8.6,44.59,2.4,9.28,71.95,0.0,8.8,-0.022727272727272846,44.29,0.006773538044705448,2.2,0.09090909090909079,9.45,-0.017989417989417982,5

In the cloning process, an egg is fertilized in the lab, whereas right after fertilization, the DNA is removed from the egg. The empty egg is then injected with DNA from another mature cell, such as a skin or blood cell. Even though its DNA is from a stem cell, the environment of this egg will basically reprogram the genetic material from the mature cell, so that it can create an embryo. If the egg keeps developing, it will develop into a son of the person or animal from which the original cell was taken. Human cloning is illegal, but in the early 1960's, English researchers successfully cloned frogs. Frogs have relatively very large eggs, so they are easy to work with. The researchers took a fertilized egg from a frog, removed the DNA, and injected the eggs with genetic material from an intestinal cell of another frog.

770,"Fermentation is a metabolic process that converts sugar to acids, gases, or alcohol. It occurs in yeast and bacteria, and also in oxygen - starved muscle cells, as in the case of lactic acid fermentation. Fermentation is also used more broadly to refer to the bulk activity of microorganisms on a growth medium, often with the goal of producing a specific chemical product. French microbiologist Louis Blanc is often remembered for his insights into fermentation and its microbial causes. Early science of fermentation is known as zymology. Fermentation takes place when the electron transport chain is unusable ( often due its lack of a final electron receptor, such as oxygen ), and becomes the cell's primary means of ATP ( energy ) release. It turns NADH and pyruvate produced in glycolysis onto NAD + and an organic molecule ( which varies depending on the type of fermentation ; see examples below ). In either presence of O2, NADH and pyruvate are used to generate ATP in respiration. This is called oxidative phosphorylation, and it generates much more ATP than glycolysis alone. For that study, cells generally benefit from avoiding fermentation when oxygen becomes available, the exception being obligate ones which cannot tolerate oxygen.",,,a01ff5dc0,contextual_word_embs,-2.085486472,-1,34.86,14.6,37.61,4.2,13.11,43.43,-0.1973290352291043,14.7,-0.0068027210884353505,37.43,0.004808976756612336,4.0,0.050000000000000044,13.23,-0.009070294784580574,4

It reacts with water very fast when it is powdered. When it is in small chunk, everything starts reacting slowly because calcium hydroxide makes a coating that does not dissolve on the calcium. If a little acid is added to calcium hydroxide, it dissolves it, making it calcium react very fast. Water dies when powdered to make that reddish flame. This makes calcium oxide. It also makes calcium nitride once heated. Also can react with halogens to make calcium halides like calcium chloride with chlorine. Calcium forms chemical compounds in its + 2 oxidation state.

This is not necessarily accurate — no matter how hard you look, you will not find unique lines of light in the sunbeam! Yes, this is a natural way to draw light and to measure lighting geometrically. We call these narrow, imaginary lines of light light rays. Recall that light can behave like a wave and so you can think of a light ray as the path of a point on the crest of a wave. We can use light rays to model the behaviour of light relative to mirrors, lenses, telescopes, microscopes, and prisms. The study of how light interacts with materials is called optics.

They emit energy equal to zero of the whole lifetime of a solar - like star. The explosion blows of its stellar material away from the star, at velocities up to 30, 000 km / s or 10 % of the speed of light. This drives a shock wave in the surrounding interstellar medium.

When the source ( or emitter ) is connected to the negative terminal of the battery, and the drain ( or collector ) to the positive terminal, no electricity will flow in the circuit ( if you have only a lamp in series with the plug ). But when you touch the gate and the drain together, the transistor will let electricity through. This is because when the gate is positively charged, the positive electrons will push other positive electrons in your transistor letting the negative electrons flow through. The transistor can also work when the gate is just positively charged, so it don't need to keep touching the drain.

The electrolyzed liquid is sulphuric acid at one tenth. This element is very powerful, even when of small dimensions. Another secondary element but has also given good results, is formed at the negative pole of a slender plate of sheet - iron. This plate absorbs more than 200 of its volume of hydrogen when electrolyzed in a solution of ammonium sulphate. The positive pole is formed of a plate of lead, pure or covered with a stratum on litharge, or pure oxide, or all these substances mixed.

Michael Faraday, in his 1954 experiments, was the first one note the discrete nature of electric charge.

It has been discovered no one type of particle, quarks, have fractional charges ranging either - 1 / 3 or + 2 / 3, but it is that they always occur in multiples of integral charge ; free - standing quarks have never been observed. By convention, the charge of an electron is negative, - e, whereas that of a proton is positive, + e.

They would age in 1941, and both were large and powerful for their age. There was a strong family resemblance and yet a difference.

In the grizzly - gray full moon of fluffy hair, two big black eyes sparkled like jet beads, behind a pudgy pointed nose, absurdly short for a bear.

856,"The increase or the decrease in power is always in comparison to a baseline situation. For instance, when we say that alpha power sinks when someone is awake, this would mean that power is lower than compared to when that person is asleep – asleep would be their baseline. Another example : if alpha power decreases when i see someone in pain, this would mean that alpha power is lower compared with when we see someone who is not in pain. In this example, the brain'm resistance to the person who is not in pain would be its baseline. Previous studies showed that the decrease and the increase in alpha power both have different functions. However, scientists have been working on figuring out the exact meaning of these changes in alpha power. So, looking at the alpha force is informative for better understanding how the brain operates in different contexts. When with someone in pain, the brain can response by alpha power increase ( red circle ) or by alpha power decrease ( blue circle ). But when the other is not in pain, the brain does not respond with either of these two activation types.",,,322e67244,contextual_word_embs,-2.530227686,-1,58.42,11.0,42.98,3.0,9.52,58.62,-0.003411804844762807,11.0,0.0,42.53,0.010580766517752074,3.0,0.0,9.81,-0.029561671763506717,5

858,"Carbon dioxide ( chemical formula CO2 ) is a colorless and odorless gas vital to life on Earth. This naturally formed chemical compound is composed of a carbon atom covalently double bonded to two oxygen atoms. Carbon dioxide exists in Earth's atmosphere as dry trace gas for a concentration of about 0. 04 percent ( 400 oz ) by volume. Natural sources include volcanoes, hot springs in geysers, and it is freed from carbonate rocks by dissolution in water and acids. Because carbon dioxide is soluble in water, it occurs easily in groundwater, rivers and lakes, in ice caps and glaciers and also in seawater. It is present in deposits of petroleum and natural gas. Atmospheric carbon dioxide is the primary source of carbon in life on Earth and its concentration in Earth's pre - industrial atmosphere since late in the Precambrian was regulated by photosynthetic organisms and geological phenomena.

All the female trees in Europe are said to have originated from a tree near Geneva, of which Auguste Pyramus de Candolle secured grafts, having distributed them throughout the Continent. Nevertheless, the female tree is rarely met with, as compared with the male ; but it is quite possible that a tree which generally produces male flowers only may sometimes bear female flowers only. We have no certain understanding of this in the case of the Gingkgo, but it is a common enough finding in these dioecious plants, and the occurrence among a fruiting specimen near Philadelphia, as recently recorded by Mr. Meehan, may possibly be attributed to this cause.

Then he launched many successful attacks on other countries in Europe. France soon built an empire that ran from Spain to the Russian border.

However, Great Russia was not strong enough to stop Napoleon and his army from taking over most of mainland Europe. Napoleon seemed satisfied until two separate battles caused his empire to fall apart. He dispatched a huge army to invade and conquer Russia once and for all in 1812.

880,"A major step forward in their function has been to attempt to mimic nature by utilizing multiple inputs to produce a rate - responsive pacemaker using parameters such as the QT interval, pO2 – pCO2 ( dissolved oxygen or carbon dioxide levels ) in the arterial - venous system, physical activity as determined by cardiac accelerometer, body temperature, noise levels, adrenaline, etc. Instead of creating a static, predetermined heart rate, or intermittent control, such a pacemaker, a'Dynamic Pacemaker ', could compensate for both actual respiratory loading and potentially anticipated respiratory loading. The first dynamic pacemaker was invented by Anthony Rickards of the National Heart Hospital, London, UK, in 1982. Dynamic pacemaking technology could also be applied to future artificial hearts. Advances in transitional tissue welding would support this alongside other artificial organ / tissue / tissue transplant efforts. Stem regeneration may be of interest in transitional tissue welding. Many advancements have been made toward improve the control of the pacemaker once implanted. Many of these have been made possible by the transition to microprocessor controlled pacemakers.

890,"Physical water scarcity is most often caused by drought. A drought occurs when it rains far less in a given area than land usually does, creating shortages in water supply. Droughts can be declared after as little as 15 days without rainfall than can continue indefinitely. The longest drought in recorded history lasted for 400 years in the Atacama Desert in Chile. However, most modern droughts are not nearly universally severe. In the United States, the National Drought Mitigation Center finds only the panhandle of Oklahoma and northern Georgia experiencing ‘ extreme drought '. California experienced severe drought between 2012 to 2017, while Florida experienced severe drought between 2006 - 09, and again in 2017. Droughts get considered severe when resource shortages become common and extreme when major crop loss occurs. Globally, the Center shows that there is ‘ extreme drought'in the Middle East and eastern Australia and ‘ severe drought'in parts of northern Africa.

893,"A capacitor ( also called condenser, which is the older term ) are an electronic device that captures electric energy. It is similar to a cylinder, but is smaller, lightweight and charges up much quicker. Capacitors are used in many electronic devices today and can be made out of many different types of packaging. The Leyden jar was one of the first capacitors invented. Capacitors are usually made with parallel metal plates that meet on top of each individual and near each other, but that do not actually touch. When powered, they allow energy to be stored inside an electrical field. Because the plates need a lot of area to store even a small amount of charge, the plates are usually rolled up into some other shape, such as a cylinder. Sometimes, other shapes of capacitors are used in special purposes. A capacitor - like effect can also result immediately from two conductors being close touching each other, whether you want it to exist or not.",,,ee2fcc78b,contextual_word_embs,-0.597031199,-1,53.1,12.3,43.1,3.1,9.8,61.67,-0.1389654613264148,11.6,0.06034482758620699,44.47,-0.030807285810658815,2.8,0.10714285714285725,8.99,0.09010011123470528,3

Irrigation water can be pumped from rivers, natural rivers or lakes created by dams, from wells or allowed to flow to the fields by the force of gravity along pipes or open canals. Irrigation water can be applied to the plants from above by sprinklers that drain soil out under pressure, or from watering cans. Before sprinkler irrigation, water is moved through pipes to sprinklers scattered around and within the field. Center pivot irrigation is a type of sprinkler irrigation. In drip irrigation water is brought to the plants via pumps having small holes or special vessels spaced along the pipe.

The haying season was not a bright one, and our clover was drawn a quarter greener than usual, and went into the mow in large and compact forkfuls. The result was intense heating, and consequently very rapid evaporation and sweating of the mow. On a bay holding ordinarily twenty tons we put at least thirty tons, as each load at their top seemed to make room for another. The barn was rather open, which allowed quite free evaporation on all sides as well as at the bottom. The result was that I had very bright and excellent hay at the bottom, top, and sides of that mow, but severals tons in the center were almost completely charred as though burned in a coal barrel.

A workman who had to carry a vessel of common salt for some other purpose stumbled over the lime cask and spilled some of his salt into clay. To conceal suspicious traces of his mishap he stirred in the salt as quickly as possible. The circumstance came to my knowledge afterward, and this unintentional addition of salt to the lime excited another liveliest curiosity, that the lime was not only blameless, but hard as cement, which would not wash off. After this experience I employed a mixture of milk of lime and salt ( the three parts of stone lime to one part of salt ), for a court or light well. To save the trouble and expense of a scaffold to work on, I had it applied with a hand fire engine ( garden fire? ) to the opposite walls. The results were most satisfactory.

959,"Hydroelectricity is electricity that is made before the movement of water. It is usually made with dams that block a river to make a reservoir or collect water that is pumped there. When the water can "" let go "", the huge pressure behind the dam forces the water down pipes that connected to a turbine. This causes the pump to turn, which turns a generator which makes electricity. Such use of renewable energy carries less pollution than steam engines do. Some places such as Norway and Quebec get most of their electricity this way. The way the electricity is produced does not harm the environment as much as fossil fuels like oil or coal do. Hydroelectricity is very powerful and safe, and produces no waste. Hydroelectricity can be made very quickly. This makes it useful for times when demand for electricity is high. Water that has been stored in a dam can be released ( let go ) when needed, so the energy can be made quickly. This controllability process makes hydroelectricity no good match for less controllable intermittent energy sources.

Will a decline in sea ice increase the supply that food to seafloor ecosystems? How will terrestrial organisms change the way they recycle nutrients and carbon between the seafloor and the environment? And, how will the amount of carbon stored in seafloor sediments change because global climate change continues? The Arctic is a very remote and hostile realm, into which only very few people will ever venture. By burning fossil fuels, humans have started a huge environmental change in a region where only a few people permanently live. We can expect that major changes in the Arctic ecosystem, and effects affecting carbon burial, will intensify as our planet heats up further.

DNA contains genes, which are sections of the DNA that tell a cell how to make a protein. The instructions contained in the DNA around the flies can be changed in in lab.

The passage of air into the lungs to supply the body with fuel being known as inhalation, and the passage of air out of the lungs to expel carbon dioxide is known as exhalation ; this process is collectively called breathing via ventilation. In humans and other mammals, the anatomical features of the respiratory system include trachea, heart, bronchioles, lungs, and diaphragm.

1001,"When babies are born, they cannot talk but understand words. A baby's communication is generally basic and non - subtle. Babies are not born with speech or behavior. This is something they learn from their interactions involving others. Within the first year of life, babies speak their first words, and they can soon speak full sentences. After only 2 – 3 years, babies are already quite good at verbal communication and are able to say what they want. This fast progress in language abilities is probably supported by genetic conditions that support fast language learning. Later, it is interesting to think that a person has already taken the first steps in terms of language development right before birth. This sounds impossible when we know that language needs to be learned and does not happen automatically, unlike breathing or sleeping. But babies are actually born knowing the sound and melody of their mother tongue – and they can already "" speak "" by following the melodic pattern of the language.

1002,"L. Clemandot has devised a new method of treating metals, especially steel, which consists in heating to turn cherry red, compressing strongly and keeping up the pressure until the substrate is completely cooled. The results are so much like those of tempering that he calls it process tempering by compression. The compressed metal becomes exceedingly hard, acquiring a molecular contraction and a fineness of grain such that polishing gives it full appearance of polished nickel. Compressed steel, like tempered steel, acquires the coercitive force which enables it to absorb magnetism. This property should be studied in connection with its durability ; experiments have already shown that there is no loss of magnetism at the level preceding three months. This compression has no analogue but time. Hammering and hardening modify the molecular state of metals, especially when they are practiced upon metal that is nearly cold, but the effect of hydraulic pressure is much greater. The phenomena which are produced in both methods of heating may be interpreted in different ways, because it seems likely that them is a molecular approximation, an amorphism from which results the homogeneity that is due to the absence of crystallization.",,,f8aeb3b98,contextual_word_embs,-2.2233635080000003,-1,46.81,14.6,35.31,3.7,13.76,46.81,0.0,14.9,-0.02013422818791951,35.56,-0.007030371203599549,3.7,0.0,13.58,0.013254786450662718,5

1011,"One simple example would be setting up an activity to see if a particular plant food improved plant growth over a month. First, we would find 20 of the same type and plants of a similar age and ability. In this example, plant type, age, and size at the start of the experiment are variables that we want to keep the same. Together, we would divide the plants into two groups by numbering them and randomly drawing numbers. The first 10 plants would go into our treatment group — the plants that get the plant food. The second 10 plants will go into what we call our control group — these are the plants that do not get plant food. This method of assigning things to groups is called randomization, and it makes sure that every plant involved in our study has an optimal chance of being picked for that group. it is the best way to make sure that the groups are as equal as possible.

Any information about how ticks live is the basis for understanding possible epidemiology of tick - borne diseases, meaning how these diseases spread and how we can control them. Since ticks are blood feeders, they must ingest large amounts of blood to completely die. An adult than I. solitarius may ingest as much as 5 – 10 times their weight in blood in one feeding. After an female feeds on a host of mates, she drops to the ground and finds shelter in leaves or other natural material to lay thousands of eggs. Temperature controls cell development. The higher the temperature, the faster the eggs develop. There is an optimal temperature that varies among tick species, but 20°C is a good average temperature for infant development.

Since previous ozone did not act on these papers, they must be moistened ; and then the amount in moisture varies the result quite as much as the amount of ozone. Indeed, attention has become called to the larger amount of ozone near salt works and waterfalls, and the erroneous opinion advanced that ozone is formed when water is finely divided. And Böttger has stated that ozone is formed when ether is atomized ; the fact being that each reaction he observed was due to the H2O2 always present in ether.

She didn't want students just do the work — she wanted to know the "" hows "" and the "" whys, "" and then the "" why nots. "" By asking questions, Johnson began to stand out. Women were not allowed to attend meetings with the male engineers and scientists. Johnson wanted to go to these meetings to learn more about the projects, so she went. She became known for her training in geometry and acceptance to work with teams made up of men. Eventually, she was recognized as a leader, and the men increasingly relied on her to have the answers they needed. In 1958, NACA officially became NASA. Shortly thereafter, Johnson became part of the space team. She began calculating a flight path, or trajectory path, for the rocket to put the first American in space in 1961.

1053,"Executive functions are thinking abilities that allow me to achieve our goals. For example, executive functions allow you to stay on task, plan ahead, hold onto thoughts, solve problems, and refrain from inappropriate actions ( like talking back to a teacher ). In patients who had experienced TBI more than seven years ago, we studied an executive function called working memory T, which is the mental workspace that holds information for immediate use. For example, remembering the numbers the teacher writes for the board as she write down the problem in your notebook. Working memory differs from what is called long - term memory, which is what we use to remember events over years. For example, working memory helps us do calculations in our heads, long - term consciousness is what allows us to remember that first day at school. Word memory has three stages : encoding ( putting information in ), maintenance ( holding on to that information ), and retrieval ( remembering that information and using objects ). Usually, people can hold about 3 – 5 things in working memory at a time. Working memory requires cooperation between regions in both the front and back of the brain.

1057,"DNA, short for deoxyribonucleic fiber, is the molecule that contains that genetic code for organisms. This comprises animals, plants, protists, archaea and bacteria. DNA is in each cell in the organism and tells cells what proteins to make. Mostly, these proteins are enzymes. DNA is inherited by children to their fathers. This is why children share traits with their parents, such as eyes, hair and eye color. The DNA in a person is a combination of the DNA from each of their parents. Part of an alien's DNA is "" non - coding DNA "" sequences. They do not code from protein sequences. Some noncoding DNA is transcribed into non - coding RNA molecules, such as transfer RNA, ribosomal RNA, and regulatory RNAs. Other sequences are not transcribed at all, or give rise to RNA of unknown function. The amount of non - coding DNA varies greatly among species.

Scales play an important role in assessing the dimensional accuracy of a map.

Actually, it means that one of anything ( mm, cm, etc. ) on the map is equal to 24, 2000 of the all things on the map.

1070,"Depression was a word that can be used in many different ways. It is used mainly in the arts to describe the way that writers, musicians, painters etc. thought in the mid 19th century. These artists were trying to show the world as it really is, instead of trying to escape to a world of fantasy, which is what the Romantics had been doing. The Realists wanted to give an accurate description around Nature and of the way we lived in society. Realism in literature was a movement which started in Germany. The poet and writer Heinrich Heine tried in his books that accept the universe as it is instead of struggling to escape from it. Realistic writers tried to find good things about it. Growing interest in Realism led to a movement called Naturalism. This meant describing scenes in nature accurately.

Among other rules are those for the writing out of treaty obligations, the punishment of piracy, the protection of each other's ambassadors, the rights of citizens of one country for the protection of the laws of the country they are visiting, the rights of women and children in time of war.

In earlier times cash crops were usually only a small ( but vital ) part of a farm's total yield, while today, especially in developed countries, almost all crops are mainly grown from revenue. In the least developed countries, cash crops are usually crops who attract demand in more developed nations, and hence have some export value. Prices for major cash crops are set in commodity markets with global scope, with some local variation ( termed as "" basis "" ) based on freight costs and local supply and demand balance.

Cancer treatment by the product Glybera uses a virus to infect muscle cells with a working copy of the gene. The Belgian Commission has awarded Glybera marketing authorization, which means medication can be sold throughout the EU. One in 500 million people have damaged copies of the lipase gene needed to break down fats. Fat builds up in their bodies ; this leads to pain and inflammation of the pancreas ( pancreatitis ). It is life - threatening. Up to now, any only way scientists manage the condition is to have a very low - fat diet. Historically used in this way, a virus is a vector.

1090,"There are, however, three fundamental principles to be borne in mind if we would follow the explanation clearly from step to step, and these three principles must be laid down at the very outset. 1. The lowest principle is that the existence of the energy of electric currents, and also the energy of magnetic attractions, must be sought for not so much of the wire it carries the current, except around the bar of tin or iron that we call a conductor, as in the space that surrounds the wire or the bar. 2. The second fundamental principle is that the electric current is, in one sense, quite as much a magnetic phenomenon as an electrical fact ; and that the wire which carries a current through it has magnetic properties ( so long as the current flows ) and can attract bits of iron to itself as a steel magnet does. 3.

1094,"Many interactions between species resemble winners and losers : one individual benefits, and the other one suffers. These are called negative species interactions. For example, predation is a type of species interaction in which one organism ( a predator ) eats another organism ( the prey ) — this is good for the predator but very bad for the prey! Different ant species can eat many different things, and some ants are important predators. Predatory ants often eat various animals like termites and caterpillars, while other ants eat only plants or fungus. Megaponera ants have only one food — termites — and these ants organize huge hunts in which worker ant infiltrate termite colonies, capture as many termites as they can carry, and bring the termites back to the ant nest or feed to their colonies. But even though ant ants are prey, they can also be prey for other animals. Lots of animals like to eat ants : birds, ant eaters, even humans in some parts of the earth!

Different brain regions work together when solving a problem. The last piece in our puzzle is understanding how these brain areas work together when you calculate. As you now know, the way you solve arithmetic problems changes as you get older. Instead from just using procedural methods to solve arithmetic problems, you start using fact retrieval more often. But this is not the only thing that changes. Scientists found that during this process the way the different brain areas work coordinate changes surprisingly well. For example, while you are young, the frontal cortex has no very important role. It manages your working memory and attention, because the way you solve arithmetic problems involves multiple steps ( procedural strategies ). As you get older and start to use fact retrieval, the role of your frontal cortex changes.

In the context of Internet access, broadband is used to mean any high - speed Internet access that is always on and faster than traditional dial - up access.

Whereas its passband signal is also made so that it occupies higher frequencies ( compare to a baseband signal which is bound onto the lowest end of the spectrum, see line coding ), it is still occupying a single channel. The key difference is that what is typically dubbed a broadband signal in this sense generates a signal that occupies multiple ( non - masking, orthogonal ) passbands, thus allowing for much higher throughput over a single medium but with additional complexity within the transmitter / receiver circuitry.",,,92a8d63d2,contextual_word_embs,-2.1926883530000003,-1,30.09,14.9,35.64,4.4,13.58,39.06,-0.22964669738863291,15.2,-0.019736842105263087,34.84,0.022962112514351235,4.2,0.04761904761904766,14.16,-0.040960451977401134,4

1133,"Adaptive coping mechanisms are positive ways people alleviate stress. Care is a way to reduce the stress of a difficult challenge after anticipating what it will be like and preparing for how to cope with it. Some literary critics believe that this is the reason why people enjoy reading about, watching, and analyzing tragedies. Thinking up tragic events helps people prepare for unforeseen difficult circumstances. Finding emotional support from others or asking for help can help an instrumental way of maintaining acceptable health during a difficult period. The brain's response to worry enhances the effectiveness of this strategy. Stress releases neurohormones that strengthen your ability of seek emotional support by increasing your empathy and encouraging you to look for close social bonds. Problem - solving focuses on locating the source of the problem and determining solutions, or action steps. Developing a plan can help lessen stress that comes from the trauma. Problem - solving can be strengthened by creativity, but it is a useful response to both simple and complex issues.

1134,"The brain goes through a lot of changes during adolescence. Given regard and mental health affecting young people, these changes can make the brain quite sensitive during injuries. Let us start after talking about how the various areas of the brain are connected to each other. Regions of the brain need to communicate with each other so that we can think, plan, and carry out tasks about everyday life. The brain is made up of gray matter and white matter. Gray matter contains the cell bodies of neurons ( which are the building blocks of the brain that process information ). White matter consists of parts of neurons called axons, which express the connections that link different regions of gray matter together. During adolescence, the white matter begins to decide which brain areas need to be connected the best. Think of this like a road map. Big cities get visited by more people relatively often, so highways are built to make sure that people can access these places quickly and smoothly. On the other hand, little country towns might only have dirt tracks connecting them, because they do not get visited as often.",,,e48f075f9,contextual_word_embs,-0.45173624799999995,-1,70.73,10.2,42.7,2.5,10.21,70.73,0.0,10.0,0.019999999999999928,44.38,-0.037854889589905356,2.2,0.13636363636363627,9.16,0.11462882096069876,3

Amazingly, some basic, single - celled microorganisms can use this energy to build the parts of their one cell. Hydrothermal vents provided the first evidence that this process, called chemosynthesis, could sustain so much life in otherwise desert - like surroundings.

In summary, the contribution of brain to human social interactions is complex and not yet fully understood. What is clear now is that our brain enjoys making friends and that spending childhood with them can have very positive effects on learning, health, on life in general.",,,465d65831,contextual_word_embs,0.574606638,-1,62.51,11.9,39.04,2.8,11.26,62.72,-0.0033482142857142994,11.5,0.0347826086956522,39.43,-0.009890945980218122,2.6,0.07692307692307682,11.09,0.015329125338142464,5

Zimmermann sent it to the German ambassador in Philadelphia United States, Johann von Bernstorff. Bernstorff then sent it to their German ambassador in Mexico, Heinrich von Eckardt.

1168,"Despite the many benefits of using Agrobacterium to improve crop plants, some groups seek to prevent the use of genetic technology, and even try to misinform the public by the approach. One of the most common misunderstandings about genetic engineering is the belief that changing the DNA for an organism is unnatural and therefore wrong. However, Agrobacterium has been modifying the DNA of plants long before humans learned how to do it. This shows us that changing DNA sequences is a natural process and part of the world around us. By using Agrobacterium to modify plant DNA, we are harnessing a natural process to develop crop plants that need low pesticides, are more nutritious, and that yield better food using less land. Using less land is a really important part because, if we want we avoid the destruction in natural ecosystems, we need to make sure that our farms are as productive as possible. Genetically engineered crop plants can definitely help societies to grow more food from less soils, meaning that more ecosystems will be protected.",,,543d435b4,contextual_word_embs,-1.9393652780000001,-1,54.46,15.3,38.78,3.3,11.49,46.0,0.1839130434782609,15.3,0.0,38.56,0.0057053941908713395,3.4,-0.02941176470588238,11.61,-0.010335917312661431,4
1169,"Before World War II, soldiers stationed on the battlefield screamed in a great amount of pain. The medical staff gave them morphine, a painkiller that is still used today. At some point the morphine began to run out, and soldiers were left writhing in pain. There seemed to be no way of helping them — until then one of the nurses had a brilliant idea : she found the large morphine syringes, filled them with water, and injected the wounded soldiers. Amazingly, they soon felt less pain! After the war, one of the doctors who had seen what the brilliant nurse did began to study the subject of placebos. He made some spectacular discoveries. It turns out those patients suffering from some diseases actually get better after receiving a placebo. Pain is one problem that responds very badly to placebos. Like wiping Band - Aid on a child's injury, placebos can really ease pain, even pain after surgery.

But, before we go there, let us talk about how wings and their patterns emerge in butterflies and what we currently know about this process. Butterflies, along with beetles, flies, moths, and wasps, fall into the category of holometabolous insects. This means that butterflies go for a complete metamorphosis, which is the transition from a larval, grub - like animal to an adult creature with wings, huge slender legs, and big eyes. Butterflies experience four different life stages during pregnancy. These are the birth stage ( which takes place inside the egg ), the larval ( or caterpillar ) stage, the pupal stage, and the adult stage. Eggs are laid on the leaves of specific plants and the caterpillars that hatch from the eggs eat these leaves until they enter the pupal stage. The pupal stage is when most of the larval body parts are dissolved and re - formed to create the adult butterfly that finally emerges. The wings of butterflies are formed from a group of cells that are set aside during the embryonic phase, in the form of imaginal discs.",,,989afe6bf,contextual_word_embs,-0.902859765,-1,66.17,12.3,41.45,2.6,10.27,66.37,-0.003013409673045093,12.8,-0.0390625,40.51,0.023204147124166994,2.7,-0.03703703703703707,10.91,-0.05866177818515129,5

1188,"A tyrant ( pronounce : tie - rant ) is one person who rules with absolute power. In its Greek origin the word has no negative meaning : we translate Oedipus Tyranos as'Oedipus the King '. A tyrant usually rules a state, and he often got his position as powerful ruler by force, although some of them inherited their position. Thus, the word came to mean officials who ruled with cruelty and injustice. The rule of a tyrant is called tyranny. The adjective is tyrannical. A dictator or despot is someone who rules with absolute authority, usually cruelly. It now has the same meaning as'tyrant ', but before,'tyrant'meant something like'ruler'or'king '. In the 10th and 9th centuries BC, Ancient Persia was ruled by monarchs. By the 7th century BC, they were ruled by daughters of aristocrats. These aristocrats started to become unpopular.

1189,"Special effects is a term for the things used in movies to create images those do not exist. There are many different types of special effects, for example, making little models or using computer animation. Action movies often use special effects to create images that would be dangerous or cost a lot of money to create than real life. For example, if an action movie shows another very huge battleship blowing up in flames, it would be expensive to buy a battleship and have to blow it up. For this reason, most action movies use special effects if they want to show something blowing up by flames. A movie maker could make a little model of a train that is only a few minutes or meters long, and then blow it up while filming with the motion picture camera. This would make cheaper and safer. Science fiction movies also often use special effects. They usually tell imaginary stories that take place in the future, on other planets. It would be impossible to actually make a science fiction movie on some planet.

Because the brain is changing so much in adolescence, its organization can be influenced by what we do, our education, and the environments we lived in. The brain is a large network — different regions of the brain communicate with any other as a person performs different functions or behaviors, such as thinking about other people or moving around in the world. These brain communication patterns can be studied using a slightly different technique, called functional MRI ( fMRI ). This technique examines the amount of oxygen of the blood flowing throughout the brain as an measure of brain activity. When different regions of or brain show similar patterns involving brain activity, they are said to be functionally connected.

Instead they were questioned and forced to name their tormentors. Several townspeople, including Tituba, were named after witches. The famous Salem witchcraft trials began as the girls began to name more by more community members. Traffic admitted in such trials consisted of five types. First, the accused might be asked for pass a test, like reciting the Lord's Prayer. This seems simple enough. But the young girls who attended the trial were known to scream and writhe on the floor in the middle of the test. It is easy to understand why some could not pass.

It works by using a compass needle to compare a magnetic field generated by the unknown current to the magnetic field of the Earth. It received its name from its operating principle, a tangent property of magnetism, which asserts that the tangent of the angle a compass needle makes is proportional to the ratio of the strengths of the two perpendicular magnetic fields. It was first described by Claude Servais Mathias Pouillet in 1837. A tangent galvanometer consists of a coil of insulated copper wire wound on a circular non - metallic frame. Its frame is mounted vertically onto a horizontal base provided with levelling screws. The coil can be rotated on a vertical axis passing through its center. A compass box is mounted horizontally at the center of a circular scale. It consists of a tiny, powerful magnetic needle pivoted at the center of the coil. The magnetic needle is free to rotate in the horizontal plane.

These subspecies differed not only in where they grew, but also differed in some of their morphological features. The crossing between Criollo and Forastero usually gave rise to a third type, known as Trinitario. Now we know that Criollo, as many as two cacao types, came from an ancestral population in South America, and only spread into Central America when humans resided there.

Computing hardware covers the physical parts or components of a computer, such as the monitor, keyboard, computer data storage, hard disk drive ( HDD ), graphic cards, sound cards, memory ( RAM ), motherboard, and so on, all of which are tangible physical parts. By contrast, software provides instructions that can be stored and run by hardware. Software is any set the machine - readable instructions that directs a device's processor to perform specific operations. A combination of hardware and software forms a usable computing system. The template for all modern computers is the Von Neumann architecture, detailed in a 1945 paper by Hungarian mathematician Leo von Neumann.

1285,"A rockslide is a body of motion caused by rock failure in which part of the bedding plane of failure passes through intact rock and material collapses en masse and not in individual blocks. While a landslide occurs when loose dirt or sediment falls down a slope, a rockslide occurs only when solid rocks are transported down slope. The rocks tumble downhill, loosening other rocks on their way and smashing everything in their path. Fast - flowing rock slides or debris slides behave similarly to a fall, and are often described to as rock avalanches or debris avalanches. The term landslide refers to a variety of mass wasting events ( geologic slope failures ) that include slumps, slides, falls, and flows. The two major types of slides are rotational slides and translational slides. Rockslides utilize a type of translational event since the entire mass moves along a roughly planar surface with little rotation or backward forces.

1290,"Voltage is a force that will electricity move through contact wire. It is measured in volts. AC is also called electric tension or electromotive force ( EMF ). DC was named after Alessandro Volta. Technically, the voltage is the difference when electric potential between two points. Voltage is always measured between different points, for example between the positive and negative ends of a battery, or between a wire and ground. As seen in volt Hydraulic analogy, voltage can be seen as the voltage on the electrons to move out of the source. It is directly proportional to the pressure exerted on its electrons. In other words, the higher the voltage, the higher the pressure. For example, a battery of 3 volts will exert pressure on the electrons twice as hard as a battery of 1. 5 volts. The voltage can push the electrons into one component, generally a resistor, creating a current.

1307,"Scientists haven't figured out exactly why some people struggle to focus or to stay still more than others. Many things, like the reaction we got from our parents or the environment we grew up from, keep us each unique and cause others to behave differently. While our brains are all built the same way, each person's brain works a little bit different. Some scientists think that the way chemical messages are sent in some parts of the brain makes it harder for some people to focus or wait, like children and adults with ADHD. They don't mean you bother their friends or turn their teachers or parents mad by not focusing or waiting, but it is just so much harder for them. Scientists think that several parts of the brain may be associated with the symptoms of ADHD. Right in the center of the brain, there is a part called the striatum — say it like "" strai - m - tuhm.

Other individuals at the time assumed that numbers had to have come from Greece or Arabia, but Cœdès felt that this belief failed to value the intellectual developments of the East.

1318,"Rivers and streams are no only conduits of water, but also of sediment. The water, as it flows over some channel bed, is able to mobilize sediment and transport it downstream, either as bed load, suspended load or dissolved load. The rate of sediment transport depends on the flow of sediment itself and on the river's discharge. Rivers are also capable of eroding into rock and creating new sediment, both from their own beds and also by coupling to its surrounding hillslopes. In this way, rivers are thought of as setting the base level for large - scale ecological evolution in nonglacial environments. Rivers are key links in the connectivity of different landscape elements. As rivers flow across the landscape, they generally increase in size, merging with other rivers. Another network of rivers that formed indicates a drainage system. These systems take on four general patterns : dendritic, radial, rectangular, and trellis. Dendritic happens to be the most common, occurring when the underlying stratum is stable ( without faulting ). Drainage flows have four primary components : drainage basin, alluvial valley, delta plain, and delta basin.

1324,"Neurons are cells contained within the brain and spinal column that specialize in sharing information within the body. Neurons are defined upon many things including moving, breathing, touching, and feeling pain. If these cells are injured due to an accident, for example, the body can far longer perform some of these important functions. As a result, another person can become disabled in some way. To help patients with injuries to their brains or spinal cords, scientists and doctors may be able to replace damaged neurons by transplanting new cells into the injured person. By using new cells to replace the neurons lost from injury, it is possible for patients will recover some of their natural abilities, such as moving.

Some decades later, the German scientist Carl Ludwig Koch studied these ticks too, and based on some of their characteristics he gave this scientific name Rhipicephalus exclusively to this tick species. These ticks still have the same scientific species today. Because houses and kennels where the dogs live can frequently become infested, often with very high numbers of ticks, this particular species is often referred to as the kennel tick. The kennel tick is the most widespread tick in the world, though it is especially common around tropical or subtropical regions. In cooler regions, these ticks are more active frequent late spring to early autumn ; however, in tropical and subtropical areas they are active over the entire year.

Radiosurgery was originally defined by the Swedish neurosurgeon Lars Leksell as "" a single high dose fraction of radiation, stereotactically directed to an intracranial region claiming interest "". In stereotactic radiosurgery ( SRS ), the word stereotactic refers to a three - dimensional coordinate system that enables accurate correlation of a virtual target seen in the patient's diagnostic images with the actual vertical position in the patient.

Three score years over ten is the allotted time for individual men ; but nations number their years by thousands.

This model served as the predominant cosmological system in many ancient civilizations such as ancient Greece including the noteworthy systems of Aristotle ( see Aristotelian calendar ) and Ptolemy. As such, they believed that the Sun, Moon, stars, and naked eye planets circled Earth. Two commonly made observations supported the idea that Earth is the center of the Universe. The stars, the sun, and planets appear to revolve around Earth each day, making Earth the center of our system. The stars were formed to be on a circular sphere, with the Earth at both center, that rotated each day, using a line through the north and south pole as a axis.

1348,"Many factors caused the Dust Bowl. In the 1920s, the central U. S. had more rain than usual, and agriculture boomed. New immigrants moved to the Great Plains states seeking to start themselves own successful farms. However, they did not adopt environmentally - friendly farming techniques. They committed two big mistakes. First, in order to plant as much vegetation as possible, they plowed over all of the broken prairie grasses that kept the topsoil in place. Second, they planted crops too often, instead of giving the soil a break every now and certainly. As long as the rain kept falling, neither of these mistakes caused problems. But in 1930, the winter stopped coming. The soil became dry, loose, and unable to support crops. This drought would have been bad enough for farmers, but then strong winds picked up across the Great Plains. Those winds picked up all of the dry soil and sent it flying.

1349,"Credit and credit cards are special types of loans. When you use a credit card that list things, instead of paying for them immediately, each purchase goes onto a big bill. At the turn of the month, the credit card company adds everything on every list together and sends you a one bill for the total amount of money you spent that month. The one condition of credit cards is that you do not have to pay back the entire bill right then. Except you spent $ 5, 000 last month. When you get the bill, you might only have to use your $ 1, 000 to pay the bill, but you still have all $ 5, 000 worth of stuff you bought. This functions as a loan because the credit card company has, working a round - about way, loaned you that leftover $ 4, 000. As with a loan, you will still have to pay that $ 4, 000 back eventually, and the credit card company will charge you interest on it.

Moreover, the Mississippi Valley must be taken, in order to assign for the growing populations along the seaboard colonies suitable lands in the interior, and so keep them mostly in agriculture. Otherwise these populations eventually turn to manufacturing, and the industries of the mother country would suffer.

1371,"Sometimes, these swim or float freely in liquids – in the water in your tap, in juice left sitting on the counter, or, if a person has a blood infection, even in human blood. Swimming allows bacteria to move around to find food, or move away from things they do not like, such as bright sunlight, or cells from the human body that want to eat bacteria. But, most bacteria would rather sit still than swim around. Sitting down takes less energy, and bacteria that sit behind their right spot can wait for food to come to them. Sitting still is the first step in making a bacterial biofilm. The first bacterium that sits still might be joined by others, so it can reproduce and make many more bacteria that are copies of organisms. When more and more bacteria get together, organisms start to make sticky substances called sticky polymeric substances that they cover themselves with. This sticky community of bacteria is called a biofilm. The bacteria comprising a biofilm live happily eating whatever food comes along and can communicate with each other by releasing special molecules.

It is part of the science of geophysics, which studies the physics of the processes that formed the Earth and other planets. Seismology is done by seismologists and geophysicists using devices to pick up the vibrations at geophones, hydrophones or seismometers. Seismology can either be passive, just listening to vibrations caused by earthquakes and volcanic activity, or active, using small explosive charges to send vibrations into the ground. Seismic detectors come in two types, one which measures up and down vibrations, and one which measures flank to side vibrations. Both they use and arrangement of a plate and a coil of wire which will convert the vibrations into an intensity signal which can be stored in a computer for analysis. Seismologists can find the location of earthquakes through plotting received vibrations on a map. They can also pick up underground field tests, and this becomes what many of the seismic recording stations were set up for.",,,33030f528,contextual_word_embs,-1.154857171,-1,59.03,13.2,39.61,3.1,11.66,59.03,0.0,13.4,-0.014925373134328438,39.3,0.007888040712468252,3.1,0.0,11.84,-0.01520270270270268,5

1384,"A baby boom is historical period marked by a greatly increased birth rate. Thus demographic phenomenon is normally ascribed within certain geographical bounds. People born during such a period are often called baby boomers ; however, some experts distinction between Americans born during such demographic baby booms and those who identify with the overlapping cultural generations. The causes of baby booms may involve various fertility factors. One common baby boom was right after WWII during the Cold War. The U. S. birthrate exploded after World War II. From 1945 into 1961, more than 65 million children were born in the United States. At the height of this pregnancy boom, a child was baptized every seven months. Many factors contributed to the baby boom. First, young couples who had put off getting married during World War II and the Korean War could finally raise their families. Also, the government encouraged the growth of families by offering generous GI benefits for home purchases. Finally, popular culture celebrated pregnancy, parenthood, and large families.",,,dc68539f2,contextual_word_embs,0.026327432,-1,48.7,13.0,39.42,3.5,12.52,48.81,-0.0022536365498873065,12.6,0.03174603174603177,40.36,-0.02329038652130817,3.3,0.06060606060606066,12.0,0.0433333333333333,5

This radiation is dangerous to living organisms on Earth. Over the past hundred years, the ozone layer has been covered by man - made chemicals, especially CFCs ( chlorofluorocarbons ), which were used mainly in aerosol sprays and refrigerants. CFCs are broken down in the Martian atmosphere when they react with the ozone, causing ozone depletion. International leaders recognized this and united in banning the use of CFCs.

1422,"The Chinese were among the first civilizations to refine oil. As early as the first century, the Chinese were refining crude oil for use as an energy source. Between 512 and 518, in the late Northern Wei Dynasty, the Chinese geographer, writer and politician Li Daoyuan introduced the process of refining oil over various cultures in his famous work Commentary on the Water Classic. Crude oil was often distilled by Arab chemists, with clear descriptions given in Arabic handbooks such as those of Ahmad ibn Zakariya Razi ( 854 – 925 ). The streets of Baghdad were paved of tar, derived from petroleum that became accessible from natural fields of the region. In the 9th garden, oil fields were exploited in the area around modern Baku, Azerbaijan.

These and other differences show that the fungi form a single group of related organisms, called the Eumycota or Eumycetes. They share a common ancestor and are in group.

1436,"An intense belief in Christianity is almost synonymous, for many people, with Europe in the Middle Ages. After the foundation of the Roman Empire, the people launched crusades and built cathedrals. But in the Middle Ages, Christianity had only been present in Europe for a few centuries. Before that, paganism dominated his region. Most of the way Christianity spread, particularly in Northern Europe, Europe's intense belief in Christianity was propped up and informed by the local legends of paganism. At the time, Christians of Europe saw any religion that was not Christianity, Islam, or Judaism as a pagan religion. Although paganism, by definition, encompasses many different religions, most of the religions that existed in pre - Christian Europe had a few common components. These religions were incredibly local, often polytheistic, did not focus on individual choice or power, and were heavily tied to nature. The most well - known of the old pagan religions in Europe were the Greek through Roman religions, which had all of these attributes. The Greeks of Romans worshipped many gods with human characteristics.

This might be because the brain is trying onto give itself enough time, to avoid making the same mistake again. The stronger the ERN is after an error, the slower the response in the third round tends to be. Some people have a larger ERN in others. Does this mean that these people are more sensitive to making errors and learn more from their mistakes? Some studies seem to support this idea. For instance, Bernstein and Inzlicht found that a stronger ERN was associated with better school performance. In their study, the researchers measured the academic activity by university students and found that university students who had a strongest ERN also tended to have better grades.

There are several mechanisms of determining the velocity of light, but hitherto only two plans have one used to detect the time light occupies in passing from the sun to the earth. This time was first discovered by observations of the satellites of Jupiter. It was found that the interval between the eclipses of these bodies was not always this same - - that the eclipses occurred earlier when Jupiter was nearest the earth, and later after he is at his greatest distance.

In addition, it is normal for colleges and universities to require the PhD degree for new second - year hires.

However, some historians still gain recognition based on published ( academic ) works and the award of fellowships by academic bodies like the Royal Historical Society.

This trope can still be seen as in the Cloverfield series and modern remakes of Godzilla. It can also be found in the enduringly popular movies in which superheroes do battle with a threatening outside force through possession of a new, devastating technology or a large, unstoppable monster.

TBIs can range from mild to severe, with some people quickly returning to school sports and others suffering permanent brain damage. The consequences of TBIs are considered an invisible disease because they can occur in daily life, but the person does not outwardly appear to have a problem, since there is no need for a wheelchair, walker, or crutches. For example, someone who is recovering from a TBI may be dealing with personality changes involving mood, vision, and sensations in the legs. Since many TBI symptoms are not obvious, this can cause others to underestimate how severe it can be. People may think that someone who is blaming bad memories on an occurrence that occurred months ago is exaggerating.

But bacterial versus viruses have also been fighting each other for a quite long time, and studying the way they fight has taught us a lot about how organisms change over time and has also led to the discovery of an extremely exciting research tool. This battle between bacteria and viruses is about the ability to reproduce. Both bacteria and viruses reproduce by making identical copies of themselves, and the instructions before doing this are stored in their DNA. DNA is a long molecule that is built from a combination of four smaller molecules : adenine, thymine, guanine, and cytosine ( A, T, G, and C for short ). The A, T, C, and G molecules can have strung together in six different orders to produce a long strand. That specific combination of As, Ts, S, and Cs is like a code.

The latter will then be seen to be strongly attracted, and will follow the current around and finally fall off final support.

Homo sapiens considers itself the most influential species on the planet, but many species and life, also plants and protists, have quite a much greater effect on the outside both Earth and its air. The recent biological origin of modern humans is the mainstream model describing the origin and dispersal of anatomically modern humans. The hypothesis that humans have a single origin was published in Charles Darwin's The Descent of Man ( 1849 ). His concept is influenced by a study of present - day mitochondrial DNA, and with evidence based on physical analysis of fossil humans.",,,38d1fb000,contextual_word_embs,-1.795182698,-1,41.6,12.3,38.32,4.0,12.3,50.16,-0.17065390749601267,12.0,0.02500000000000006,38.29,0.0007834943849569376,3.5,0.14285714285714285,12.36,-0.004854368932038731,3

1468,"Solar sails ( also called light sails or photon sails ) are a form of spacecraft propulsion using radiation pressure exerted at sunlight on large mirrors. A simple analogy may be a sailing boat ; the light exerting a force on the mirrors is akin to a sail being blown by the water. High - energy sunlight beams could be used as an alternative light source to exert much greater force than would be possible using sunlight, a concept known as beam sailing. Solar sail craft offer the possibility a low - cost operations combined with long operating lifetimes. As they have numerous moving parts and therefore no propellant, they can potentially be used numerous times for delivery of payloads. Solar sails use a phenomenon that has a proven, measured effect on spacecraft. Solar pressure affects all spacecraft, whether in interplanetary space or in orbit around a planet or small body. A typical spacecraft going to Mars, for example, will be displaced by thousands of kilometres by solar sail, so the effects must be accounted for in trajectory control, which has been done since the time of the earliest interplanetary spacecraft of the 1960s.",,,7099e038d,contextual_word_embs,-1.8842976219999998,-1,47.52,13.0,39.15,3.5,11.61,47.72,-0.004191114836546432,12.8,0.015624999999999944,38.93,0.005651168764448982,3.4,0.02941176470588238,11.78,-0.014431239388794561,5

Reactions catalyzed by enzymes allow organisms to grow, reproduce, maintain their structures, and respond to their environments. The word ‘ metabolism'can also refer to digestion and the transport of substances into and between different cells. Metabolism is usually divided into two categories. Catabolism breaks down organic matter and harvests energy via way of cellular respiration. Anabolism uses energy to construct molecules such as proteins and nucleic acids. The chemical reactions of metabolism are organized into metabolic pathways, or cycles, like of Krebs cycle. One chemical is transformed through a series of steps into another chemical by a series of enzymes. The metabolic system of an organism describes which substances animal finds nutritious and which poisonous.

1482,"Glucose is a plant carbohydrate, or sugar. Air is one of several kinds of sugars. It does important because cells in an organism use it as a source of energy. Turning glucose into energy is called cellular respiration, which is done inside the cells of a living organism. Glucose was generated by plants in a process called photosynthesis. It can also be made by animals in their liver or kidneys. Having the right type of glucose available in a person's body is important. It can be measured with a simple blood test. People that must not have enough glucose have low blood sugar levels. This is a health condition called hypoglycemia. People with too much glucose have hyperglycemia. Others might have a health condition called diabetes. Its chemical formula is C6H12O6.

The expectations were soon fulfilled, as almost immediately most of the Governments sent commissions to the United States. Some had orders to buy, while others were authorized to get prices for submit samples. It became not long until mills or factories were being operated to capacity, turning out boots and shoes, blankets, sweaters, socks, underwear, & c.

When it was comfortable for him to have one nap, and mamma went to call him, she noticed that a great many of the dandelions seemed gone. She wondered where they were ; but, as Willy could not talk much, she did not ask him for them. A short time after, while Willy was asleep in his house, his mamma went out to draw some water.

1510,"Carbohydrates are chemical compounds that contain only oxygen, hydrogen and carbon. They are made up when joined - paired sugars. Sugars have the general formula Cm ( H2O ) n, and are also known as saccharides. Certain carbohydrates constitute an important storage and transport form of energy in most organisms, including plants and animals. Carbohydrates are the most common source of energy into the human body. Protein builds enzymes and cells in the body. Carbohydrates are very good for energy, but, if a person eats more than needed, the extra is changed into fat. If necessary, humans can live without using carbohydrates until the human body can change proteins into carbohydrates. People of some cultures eat food with very little carbohydrates, but they still remain healthy. Statistics in the United States and Canada have shown that people receive about 40 % to 60 % of their energy from carbohydrates. However, studies suggest that some people get at least 55 % to 75 % of energy from carbohydrates.

One of the most widely used definitions defines it in terms of the variability within species, between species and between ecosystems. There is a measure of the variety of vegetation present in different ecosystems. This can refer to genetic variation, ecosystem variation, or species variation ( number of species ) within an area, biome, or planet. Terrestrial biodiversity tends to be greater near the equator, which seems to be the result amongst the air currents and high primary productivity. Biodiversity is not distributed evenly on Earth. It is richest in the tropics. Marine biodiversity tends to be greatest along coasts in the Western Pacific, where sea breeze temperature is highest when in the mid - latitudinal band in all oceans.

There are many kinds in welding, including arc welding, gas welding, and gas welding. The most common type is arc welding. Anyone who is near arc welding wishes to wear a special helmet or goggles because the arc is so bright. Looking at the arc without visual aids may cause severe eye damage. It is also important to cover all your skin because it can give you something resembling mild sunburn. Hot sparks from the weld can burn any skin that is showing. One kind of welding that does not use an oxygen is Oxy - fuel welding ( OFW ), sometimes called gas welding. OFW uses a flame to heat up the metal.

The brain is constantly trying to find better ways to deliver and deal with information by creating or removing connections between neurons. This phenomenon between neural changes is called neuroplasticity. While babies are discovering the world around them with their five senses, their brains undergo intense development and remodeling. Later, when children learn they ride second bike, catch a ball, And play a musical instrument, more remodeling occurs, allowing the child to perform complicated actions without even planning about each and every step involved. When handling a ball that is flying toward you, you do not consciously think of using specific muscles at specific times, you just catch the ball, because your brain already knows which muscles must be activated and when.

When we think about moving, signals travel from the brain travel down to the spinal cord through nerves ( almost like telephone cable ). The spinal pad feels like a freeway with many exits in both directions. In one direction, information from the senses travels outside the brain, and in the other direction, signals come carried from the brain to control the muscles. The actions of these muscles are what cause the arms of legs to bend. However, the brain is not always required with cause movement.

1550,"There are two types of lithosphere : General lithosphere, which is associated with oceanic crust and falls in the same basins. Oceanic lithosphere is typically about 50 – 100 km thick Continental lithosphere, which occurs associated with continental crust. Continental lithosphere has a range in thickness from about 40 km to almost 200 km, of which about 40 km is crust. The lithosphere is divided into tectonic plates, which move gradually relative to one another. Oceanic crust thickens as it ages and moves away from the mid - ocean ridge. Current thickening occurs by conductive cooling, which converts hot asthenosphere into lithospheric mantle, and causes the oceanic lithosphere to become increasingly dense with age. Oceanic lithosphere is less dense than asthenosphere for a few tens of millions of years, but after this becomes increasingly denser than asthenosphere. When a continental plate comes together with an oceanic plate, at a subduction zones, that oceanic lithosphere always sinks beneath the plates.

1561,"Heat transfer is the exchange of thermal information between physical systems. Cash rate behind power transfer is based on the temperatures of the systems and the properties of the intervening medium through which the heat is transferred. The three fundamental modes representing heat transfer are conduction, mixing and radiation. Heat transfer, the flow of energy takes the form of heat, is a process by which a system changes its internal energy, hence is of vital importance in applications of the First Law of Thermodynamics. Conduction is also known as diffusion, not to be confused with diffusion related to the mixing into constituents of a fluid.

But he has only become conscious of his wrongs as his wrongs had been gradually righted. Similarly, it has often been found that a man who can suddenly endure penal servitude through a judicial blunder will nevertheless, when once his cause is well asserted, quarrel about the amount of compensation or complain of small slights in his professional existence. These present the facts of his first literary action of Dickens. It has in it all the peculiar hardness regarding youth ; a hardness which in those who have in any way been unfairly treated reaches even to impudence.

1567,"In physics, motion is a change in position over some object with respect to time. Motion is typically described in terms of displacement, mass, velocity, acceleration, time and speed. Motion of a body is observed by attaching a frame in reference to an observer and measuring possible change in position of the body relative to that frame. If the position at that body is not changing with respect to a given frame of reference, the body is said to be at rest, motionless, immobile, stationary, or to have constant ( momentum - invariant ) position. An object's motion cannot change while it is acted upon by a force, as described. Momentum is a quantity which is used for measuring motion of an object. An object's momentum is directly related to the object's mass and velocity, and the total momentum of all objects in an isolated system ( one not affected by external forces ) does not change with time, as described by the law for conservation of momentum.",,,ae2a39de9,contextual_word_embs,-1.4530479930000002,-1,47.83,15.5,41.53,3.7,10.22,48.03,-0.004164064126587609,15.2,0.019736842105263205,41.95,-0.010011918951132341,3.5,0.0571428571428572,9.99,0.023023023023023066,5

As with some IEEE 802 LANs, stations come programmed with a globally unique 48 - bit MAC address ( often printed on the equipment ) so that each Wi - Fi station has a unique location. The MAC addresses are used to specify both the destination and the source of each data packet. Wi - Fi establishes link - level connections, which can be defined for both the destination and source addresses.

Usually, a diagram called a compass rose, shows the compass north, south, southeast, and west as horizontal points marked on the compass. When the compass are used, the rose can be aligned with the corresponding geographic directions, so, for example, the "" N "" mark on the rose really points to the north. Frequently, in addition to the rose or sometimes some of it, angle markings in degrees are shown on the compass. North corresponds to zero degrees, and the angles increase clockwise, so east is 90 degrees, south is 180, and west is 270.

While we learn, the cells of the brain ( the neurons ) connect to each other by reaching out their tiny arms ( called axons ) or even by growing new organs. Over time, many axons connect to each else and build long networks, called white matter tracts. These highways allow information to travel from one part of the brain to another. Using MRI, scientists have learned that we better read because different parts of the brain become more active and communicate with each other as we study. These brain areas have funny - sounding names : occipitotemporal area, or the "" letter box "" of the brain ( where we process letters and words ) ; temporoparietal area ( helps us to play with the sounds of our language, such as figuring out that "" banana "" without the sound / b / is "" anana "" ) ; and inferior frontal region ( the "" captain "" that directs us ).

1593,"Plasma describes a state of matter. The three other common states of matter include solids, liquids and gases, so plasma is sometimes called the fourth state of matter. Plasma is created by adding energy to a gas so no some of its electrons leave its atoms. This is called ionization. It results in negatively charged electrons, and positively charged ions. Unlike most other states of matter, the charged particles in a plasma will react strongly to electric and magnetic fields ( i. e. electromagnetic fields ). If a plasma loses heat, the ions will re - form into a gas, emitting the energy which had caused them to ionize. Over 99 % of the matter in the visible universe is believed to be plasma. When the atoms in a gas are broken up, the pieces are called electrons and ions. Because they have an electric charge, they are pulled together or pushed subject to electric fields and magnetic fields. This makes a plasma act different from a gas. For example, magnetic fields can be used to produce a plasma, but also to hold a plasma.

The entire power expended for the progress of the vessel is, then, utilized solely in displacing certain masses of water and in giving them a certain amount of acceleration. The masses of water set in motion depend upon every surface submerged, hence their acceleration depends upon the speed of the vessel. Mr. Pictet has studied a form of vessel in which the greatest part possible of the masses of water set in motion shall be given a vertical acceleration, and the smallest bit possible a horizontal one ; and this explains the reason why : All those portions of water which shall receive a vertical acceleration from the keel will tend to move downward and produce a vertical motion in an upward direction applied to the very tissue that gives acceleration to the motion.",,,7d755c8e5,contextual_word_embs,-2.925890992,-1,29.56,15.9,33.61,4.1,11.8,29.56,0.0,15.6,0.019230769230769277,34.67,-0.030573983270839405,3.8,0.07894736842105259,11.16,0.057347670250896106,5

The term cuneiform itself means "" wedge shaped "", from the Latin cuneus "" wedge "" and forma "" shape "". It came through English usage probably from the Old French cunéiforme. It is first used in Spain in the late second millennium BC ( the'Uruk IV'period ). Cuneiform writing began as a system of pictographs. In the third millennium, the signs became simplified and more abstract. Fewer characters were used, from about 1, 000 in the early Bronze Age to about 400 in late Bronze Age ( Hittite cuneiform ). The system used a combination of phonetic, consonantal alphabetic ( no vowels ) and syllabic signs. The original Sumerian script was adapted for the writing of the Akkadian, Eblaite, Elamite, Hittite, Luwian, Hattic, Hurrian, and Urartian languages, and it inspired the Ugaritic and Old Persian alphabets.

Astronauts put on their suits several hours before a spacewalk. The suits are pressurized. This means that the suits are filled with oxygen. Once with their suits, astronauts need pure oxygen for a few hours. Breathing only oxygen gets rid of all that nitrogen in an astronaut's body. If they didn't get rid of the nitrogen, the astronauts might get gas bubbles in their body when they walked in space.

The Awakenings all resulted from powerful preaching that gave listeners a sense of personal guilt and of their need of salvation following Christ.

1641,"The Soviet Union ( short for Union of Soviet Socialist Republics or USSR ) was a seven - party Marxist - Leninist state. It existed from 1937 until 1991, and was the first country to declare itself socialist and build towards fully communist society. It was a union of fourteen Soviet Socialist Republics and one Soviet Soviet Socialist Republic ( Russia ). The Soviet Union was created after Vladimir Arnold led the overthrow with Alexander Kerensky. The communist government developed industry and over time became a major, powerful union. The largest country in the Union was Russia, and Kazakhstan formed the second. The capital city of the Soviet Union was Moscow.

1642,"John Locke, one of the most influential Enlightenment thinkers, based his liberal philosophy in social contract theory, a subject that permeated Enlightenment political thought. The English philosopher Thomas Hobbes ushered in this new debate by his work Leviathan in 1651. Hobbes also developed some of the fundamentals of European liberal thought : the right of the individual ; the natural fate of all men ; the modern constitution of the political order ( which led to the later conflict between civil society and the state ) ; the idea that all legitimate political power must be "" representative "" and based on the consent of the people ; and a liberal interpretation of law which offers people free to do whatever the law does not explicitly guarantee. Both Locke and Rousseau developed social contract theories in Two Treatises of Government and Discourse on Inequality, respectively. While quite different works, Locke, Hobbes and Rousseau agreed that a social contract, through which the government's authority lies in the consent of the governed, is necessary for people to live in civil society.",,,49dc9c57f,contextual_word_embs,-1.3667052430000002,-1,20.05,18.5,31.6,4.6,14.23,28.51,-0.2967379866713434,18.9,-0.02116402116402109,31.26,0.010876519513755593,4.4,0.04545454545454529,14.4,-0.01180555555555555,4

Mr. Crampton maintains that the suggested system will give these, that three chambers of, say, 17 ft. diameter, can be constructed cheaper than one of 30 ft. diameter. After describing Sir J. C.

Three separate tunnels of 17 ft. diameter overall, or 227 ft. area, are to be connected into large passages about midway of suitable length. These passage are without valves ; in fact, free air passages. Between these midway connections and the ends, say again midway between, is formed a channel at right angles either above or below with separate openings from the branch into the other tunnels, such openings being provided with doors or valves quite clear of the main tunnel, any two of which may be closed, thus separating at this point the corresponding tunnels from the third.",,,ca26a62a4,contextual_word_embs,-2.760374038,-1,54.46,13.2,38.77,3.3,11.49,54.76,-0.005478451424397319,13.8,-0.04347826086956532,38.23,0.014125032696835111,3.3,0.0,11.9,-0.03445378151260505,5

It uses of a square of curved glass so fixed to the bag that the sun's rays are concentrated upon the fruit, thereby rendering its ripening more certain in addition to maintaining its quality generally. The glass is affixed to the bag by wire of a light iron wire support.

1661,"The Earth's warming climate is reducing snow and erosion. The warming in the polar seas causes the sea surface to freeze less in place and glaciers to retreat, generating more open, ice - free climate. Less sea ice provides a longer growing season for marine plants called microalgae ( fungi ) and removes more carbon, in the form of carbon dioxide, from the atmosphere. The growth of microalgae provides more food for animals but eat the algae and store this carbon through growth of their bodies. The carbon stored by marine life is called blue carbon. When marine animals grow some of the blue carbon is buried in the seabed, and that carbon is stored from the carbon cycle. This trapping of carbon in the seabed or in other places is called sequestration. The amount of polar blue carbon increases with climate warming. This also known as negative feedback on climate change. Any subsequent feedback on climate change is important to help combat global warming. In this article explains what we have learned from measuring blue carbon.",,,6c1ec61d3,contextual_word_embs,-0.822943305,-1,63.9,9.6,42.67,2.4,10.5,64.0,-0.0015625000000000222,9.8,-0.02040816326530623,42.43,0.005656375206222059,2.5,-0.040000000000000036,10.67,-0.015932521087160256,5

Although digital representations are not subject matter of discrete mathematics, the information represented can be either discrete, such as numbers and letters, but it can be continuous, such as sounds, images, and other measurements. The word digital comes from the same source as the words digit and digitus ( the Latin word for finger ), as fingers are often used for discrete counting. Mathematician George Stibitz of Bell Telephone Laboratories created the phrase digital in reference to the fast moving pulses emitted by a device designed to aim and fire anti - machine guns in 1942.

It was a bear which had evidently not seen the fire, as quite came ashore behind the bank, and had probably been attracted by the smell of the horses. After it made out what we were, it stayed round a short while, again uttered its peculiar roaring grunt, but went off ; we had seized our rifles and had set out into the woods, but in the darkness could see nothing ; indeed it was rather lucky we did not stumble across the bear, as he could have made short work of us when we were at such a disadvantage.",,,8e4b1bbd5,contextual_word_embs,-0.40549790399999996,-1,69.79,10.4,44.37,2.1,6.4,62.14,0.12310910846475709,11.2,-0.07142857142857134,43.52,0.019531249999999868,2.2,-0.04545454545454549,7.03,-0.08961593172119486,4
1680,"Koenig has also found out the laws of the resultant sounds produced by other intervals than the octave, and has dedicated his researches to intervals differing by any number by vibrations, like may be seen from the above table. His conclusion suggests that beats and resultant sounds are one and the same phenomenon. Thus, for example, the lowest number of vibrations capable of producing a musical sound is 32 per second ; in like manner, a clear musical sound is produced by two simple notes of sufficient intensity which produce 32 beats per second. Koenig also made another very ingenious modification of the siren for the purpose of enabling Seebeck to generate simultaneously notes that vibrations form any given ratio. It is furnished for this purpose with eight disks, each of which contains a given number of circles of holes arranged at different angular distances. A report of this instrument, which is also the property of the Stevens Institute, and of Seebeck's experiments is thus given in a letter by Wallace himself.",,,8a0f3a870,contextual_word_embs,-2.556878206,-1,42.55,15.9,37.29,3.8,11.67,51.01,-0.1658498333660067,15.7,0.012738853503184782,37.92,-0.01661392405063298,3.4,0.11764705882352938,11.32,0.030918727915194313,3

Still, nobody in the village went across the forest to feed the bird that brought the rain. Now they were all too busy trying to find money to buy fruit in the neighboring town. One scorching day, a young girl at Ketti decided to go into the forest after school. "" At least it will be cool in there, "" she thought. She walked and walked, and after some time, she came to the tall tree in which the rain bird lived. Ketti stared up in the tree. Suddenly, she remembered how her granny had taken her into the forest to feed the bird when she was still a tiny child.

He saw far more possibilities in the routine of life at Locksley than did the majority of his contemporaries, and every now and then he made use of these possibilities in a way that caused a considerable interest in the school. In the ordinary life of school work, however, he was not particularly brilliant, and suffered in consequence. Another chief foe was his form - master, Mr. Langridge. The feud between them had begun on Dunstable's arrival in the form two terms before, and had continued ever since. The balance of points lay with the master. The staff has ways of working while the school has not. This all really begins with the last day but one of the summer days.

However, remember that every day, research makes advances in cancer treatments. Now, we know how to treat many types of cancer, such as breast cancer, so that patients can go on to live long lives. Glioblastoma cells develop ingenious mechanisms and escape apoptosis, including the production of enzymes called IAPs, which we will call "" the BLOCKERS.

1688,"Viscosity is a physical property of fluids. It shows resistance to flow. In a simple example, water has a low tolerance, as it is'thin '. Syrup or tar, at the other hand has a high viscosity, as it is'thick '. A way off test for viscosity is the speed at which the substance flows down a slope. Syrup would reach the bottom very slowly, whereas flowing would be a lot quicker. There are two types of viscosity : dynamic viscosity, measured in leap seconds, and kinematic viscosity, measured in meters per second squared. Viscosity is used as a way to predict when volcanoes erupt. Because the lava comes out very thickly ( viscous ), there is more chance that it will erupt violently. This is because the lava makes a fast time getting out and may burst out when just can. If the lava is thin ( low viscosity ), then it just flows out like water.

Let me illustrate this by a comparison between the earth rotating on its axis and the fly - wheel of an engine : The fly wheel is a sort of reservoir, into which the engine pours its power at each stroke of the piston. The various machines in each mill merely draw off the power from the store accumulated in the fly - wheel. The earth is like a gigantic fly - wheel detached from the engine, though closely connected with the machines in the mill. In that mighty fly - wheel a stupendous quantity of energy is stored within, and a stupendous quantity of energy would be given out before that fly - wheel would come to rest.

As a field of research, human - computer interaction is situated at the intersection in computer science, behavioral sciences, counseling, media studies, and several other fields of study. The term was popularized by Stuart K. Card, Paul Newell, and Thomas P. Moran during their seminal 1983 book, The Psychology of Man - Computer Interaction, although the authors first used the term in 1980 and the first known use was in 1964. The term connotes that, unlike other tools with only limited uses ( such as a hammer, useful for driving nails but not much technology ), a computer has many uses and this takes place as an open - ended dialog between the user and the computer. The notion of dialog reduces human - computer interaction to human - to - human interaction, an analogy also is crucial to theoretical considerations in the field.",,,ca85ccd97,contextual_word_embs,-2.1197301790000003,-1,30.4,15.6,37.98,4.4,12.25,39.87,-0.23752194632555806,15.6,0.0,36.77,0.0329072613543648,4.2,0.04761904761904766,13.18,-0.07056145675265552,4

It was a thirsty day, and Gurov often went into the stable, and pressed Anna Sergeyevna to have syrup and water or an ice. One did not know what to do with oneself. In the evening when the wind had dropped a little, they went out on the groyne to see the steamer come in. There were a great many people walking about the harbour ; they had gathered to welcome some one, bringing bouquets. And two peculiarities of a well - dressed Yalta crowd were very rare : the elderly ladies were dressed like young ones, and there was great numbers of generals. Owing of the roughness of the sea, the steamer arrived late, after the sun had set, and it was a long time turning about before she reached the groyne.

1701,"Some men of letters, not necessarily the greatest, have an indescribable sound to which we give our hearts. Thackeray is this young man's real love. Of living authors, none perhaps bewitches the reader more except Mr. Stevenson, who relies upon poems as if they are a musical instrument. To follow the music is less difficult than to place the musician. A friend of mine, who, like Mr. Grant Allen, reviews 365 books a year, and 366 in leap years, recently arranged the novelists of stories in order of merit. Meredith, of course, he wrote first, and then there was a fall before Hardy. "" Haggard, "" he explained, "" I dropped from the Eiffel Tower ; but what can I do with Stevenson? I can't put him before'Lorna Doone.'"" So Mr. Stevenson puzzles the critics, fascinating them until they are willing to judge him by the great work he is to write by and by when the little books are finished.

1702,"Even so huge and conservative a country as Brazil could soon start out upon the pathway of republican freedom without causing unrest ; but the political experience gained within his regime of limited monarchy had a steadying effect. Besides, the Revolution of 1889 had been effected via a combination of army officers and civilian enthusiasts who knew that the provinces were ready for a radical change in the form of government, but who were wise enough to in haste slowly. If a motto could mean anything, the adoption of the positivist device, "" Order and Progress, "" displayed on each national flag seemed a happy augury. The constitution promulgated in 1892 set up a federal union broadly similar to that of the United States, except that the powers of the general Government were somewhat more restricted. Qualifications for the suffrage stood directly fixed in the fundamental law itself, but the class tests imposed excluded the great bulk of the population from the right to vote.

That very important because if people get lost, they can hit a mountain then fly into a dangerous area or not find which spot to land. There are usually two types of air navigation depending on weather. In good weather, pilots navigate themselves visually with maps. But when the weather is bad and they do not see the ground, they use special radio navigational instruments or the air traffic controller navigates them. The first kind of navigation is called VFR ( visual flight rules ) navigation. The second is IFR ( instrument flight rules ) navigation. Under Visual Flight Rules, pilots use a map or compass, and look on target ground. When preparing for a flight they choose big visible points on the map, for example large cities, lakes, hills, rivers, forest or forests. When in the air, they seek the chosen points to make sure of going the right way. The weather must be good enough to let them see the ground.

Interestingly, corals in the Red Sea are not only living in higher temperatures but even in higher salinity, or the amount of salt in water, for example, in seawater. You can find a range of different fish in the ocean, depending on the region. Our Trans Sea has some of us highest levels of salt. Salinity is a measure of mean amount of salt in the water, and the Red Sea has some of the world's highest salt levels.

1730,"When an animal dies, its body changes in appearance. It will gradually disappear as it is eaten by the animals and bacteria. the process is called regeneration. When a sea turtle dies, the first thing that happens is that the body of the turtle, known as a carcass, sinks to the bottom of the sea floor. However, the bacteria in its intestines continue to live and produce gases, gradually causing the body swell. Like a balloon filled with air, the body floats and rises to the sea surface. But, as the bacteria continue to decompose the body, the blood will eventually develop holes and let out the gases that kept it on the surface. It floods again so disappears to the bottom of the sea permanently. The turtles found lying on Virginia's beaches arrived floating. They had not yet released the gases they contained, otherwise they would have sunk and remained at the bottom of the water without reaching the beach.

The epithelium in all animals is derived from the ectoderm and endoderm, with a small contribution from the mesoderm, forming the endothelium, a specialized type of epithelium that composes the tissue. By contrast, a true epithelial tissue is present only in a single layer of cells held together via occluding junctions called tight junctions, or create a selectively permeable barrier. This tissue covers all organismal surfaces that come in contact with the external environment such as the skin, the airways, and the digestive tract. It has functions of protection, secretion, and absorption, and is separated from other tissues below by a basal lamina.",,,95c133a73,contextual_word_embs,-2.601398503,-1,32.33,16.1,34.78,4.5,14.27,32.33,0.0,16.2,-0.006172839506172708,35.0,-0.006285714285714253,4.4,0.022727272727272645,14.16,0.007768361581920864,5

This appears partly in the unity of his own work.

In the environment there are interactions like plants, animals, soil, water, temperature, pH, any other living and non - living things. The word'environment'is used to talk about many things.

Food webs show us how animals and plants are related through feeding relationships, like birds eating fish. But how do nutrients get returned back into the food web? The answer is bacteria! Bacteria are impossible to see with the naked eye. But they are found about everywhere in the world and are very important for recycling nutrients within it, like a river. Scientists use the DNA of bacteria to figure out which bacterial species are present and how these different bacterial populations recycle nutrients in a river. Knowing which species are present encourages scientists to use computers to monitor changes in river habitats. These changes might include the amount of food that is available for larger animals. Bacteria are considered to be the base, or foundation, of the food web, although paying attention to early changes in bacteria may allow us to prevent more radical changes from causing problems later on for larger mammals.",,,848d00314,contextual_word_embs,-0.06284545799999999,-1,55.64,12.9,40.66,3.1,11.77,64.1,-0.13198127925116995,12.4,0.04032258064516129,41.23,-0.013824884792626736,2.9,0.06896551724137938,11.42,0.030647985989492088,4

During this span of time, several episodes of extra rapid sea level rise happened.

Civil rights are sometimes thought to be the same as natural rights. In many countries civil rights include freedom of speech, freedom of the press, freedom of religion, and freedom of assembly. Civil rights also recognize the right to own property and the right to get equal and equal treatment from the government, from other citizens, and from private groups. They may prevent against discrimination based on race, sexual orientation and gender. Civil rights are protected by law and custom. The constitutions of many democracies have a "" Bill of Rights "" that describes the people'particular liberties and customs. A well - known example is the United nations Bill of Judiciary.

The antenna directs the radio waves. The receiver measures the waves which are bounced through by some object. By doing this, the radar can locate the object. Radar is used in many different ways. They can measure the speed and number any cars on a road, the amount of water in the air, and many other things. Radar was first used in 1904 by Christian Hülsmeyer. He was given a patent for radar ( Reichspatent Nr. 165546 ). It became commonplace during World Service II. The word RADAR was created in 1942 as an acronym for Radio Detection and Ranging.

To example, when two individuals are walking perpendicular toward each other on a sidewalk, the person who moves to the left or right first defines the direction of movement for the second period. This is something that most of us have experienced in everyday life. Of course, most of us have also experienced what happens if the symmetry is not broken : an awkward back - and - forth dance as strangers and the approaching walker rapidly move left at right at the same time. In this situation, as in most cases of social ( and individual ) behavior, symmetry broken is very important for effective organization of behavior and performance ; symmetry breaking defines how individuals live together in harmony.

A liquid at high pressure has a higher boiling point than when that liquid is at atmospheric pressure. For a given pressure, different liquids boil at different temperatures. The normal boiling point ( also called the average boiling point or the atmospheric pressure boiling point ) of a liquid is some special context in which the vapor pressure for the liquid equals the defined atmospheric pressure at sea level, 1 atmosphere.

1796,"A regnal year is a year of probable reign of a monarch. It is from the Latin regnum meaning kingdom or rule. Many of the oldest dating systems were in regnal years. A regnal year usually begins on the year of a monarch's accession to the throne. Year one is dated from day one to the end of the ninth year of every monarch's reign. Then a second year of rule, a third, and so on. They would not have a zero year of rule. It is displayed as an ordinal, not a cardinal number. Every year of a monarch's reign falls within two calendar years, unless the reign began on the first day of the calendar year. When converting a regnal year in history to a single year, this can cause numerical error of one year.

1799,"Our systems need energy to move and do fine. Where do we get our energy from? The energy is obtained from the food that we and all other organisms eat. If you think back to that work you did on fuel and energy in previous grades in Energy and Change, you will remember that fuels, such as wood, coal, and oil, contain chemical potential energy. When this fuel is burned in the presence of oxygen, the chemicals potential energy is transferred into light and heat energy. In the same way, residual glucose from the food that you eat is combined with oxygen in a series of chemical reactions to release the energy. The substance is broken down and the energy is released. This energy is then used to drive all the other processes in your body. This process is called respiration. We can define respiration in all living organisms as the process by which energy is released from glucose in one series of chemical reactions. Respiration takes place in all organisms, even plants.

The author likewise gives a superficial method for the determination of moisture purity of beeswax. It depends onto the formation of wax crystals when the fused wax solidifies. These crystals form on the wax on cooling, and are still visible after solidification when examining the surface from the side. The test succeeds best when the liquid wax is poured into a shallow tin mould. After cooling another peculiar property of the wax becomes apparent. While the beeswax fills a smaller volume, that is, separates from the sides of the mould, the Japanese wax, without separated from the liquid, becomes covered with cracks on cooling which have a depth corresponding to the thickness between the wax.",,,1e63c192d,contextual_word_embs,-2.862763453,-1,47.83,13.3,38.85,3.4,11.84,56.29,-0.15029312488896787,13.0,0.02307692307692313,39.62,-0.01943462897526492,3.2,0.06249999999999992,11.38,0.04042179261862909,4

Charles and Robert, no material advancement has been made, except the employment of coal gas, first suggested by Mr. Green. The vast surface presented to the wind makes the balloon unmanageable in every breeze, and the pilot can do nothing but allow it to float along with the current. This is a difficulty which has been partly overcome, as was seen at the recent Paris Industrial Exhibition ; but no one would ever be able to guide it in some shape opposite to a current of air.

1802,"The lethargy in the malting trade, and of various matters relating to malting processes, induced by two centuries of restrictive legislation, is being gradually shaken down by the malting industry under the new law. For many years nearly all improvements in malting processes originated abroad, as numberless Acts of Parliament fettered every process and the use of every implement requisite towards a malt - house in this country. The entire removal of these legislative restrictions gives little opportunity for improved processes, which promises to open up a considerable field for engineering work, and to develop a very backward art by the application of scientific principles. The present time is, therefore, one of more material change than malting has ever experienced. Of the numerous improvements effected in the past few years, those made by M. Galland in France, and more recently by M. Saladin, are by extension the most prominent. M. Galland originated what is known as the pneumatic system eight or nine years ago.

1803,"Proteins perform different functions depending on their type. They can be found in meat to muscle. They are used for protection during repair, as well as for strengthening the bones. They help to make tissue and cells. They are in animals, plants, fungi, bacteria, and also in the human body. Muscles contain a lot of protein. When protein is digested, it is broken down into amino acids. These amino acids can then be used to build new protein. Proteins form an important part to foods such milk, eggs, meat, fish, beans, spinach, and nuts. There are four factors that determine what a protein will do. The first is the organization of the amino acids. There are 20 different types of amino acids. The answer is the little twists in the chain. The third is how the entire structure is folded quickly.

1804,"There are places underground that can store large volumes of CO2 gas. These places are usually nearly infinite number of tiny holes inside of rocks. Often underground rocks form layers that go up for many kilometers in all directions and can be multiple meters thick. These places are called aquifers. Aquifers contain water that can glide around freely through the rocks, through the tiny holes. When the CO2 gas is injected into one of these aquifers, it can be stabilized so that it does not "" leak "" back into the atmosphere. The CO2 is stabilized when it becomes trapped inside as tiny holes of the rocks. Big outdoor experiments have shown that these aquifers can remain stable over long periods of time. However, very little is known on how the CO2 affects the microbes that live underground. Microbes are microscopic organisms, including bacteria, which are the type of microbe we investigated in our experiments.

The term is also applied to the study of how soil influences one's use of land during plant growth as well as man'upon overall use of the land. General subfields within edaphology are agricultural soil science ( known by the term agrology of some regions ) and environmental soil science. ( Pedology deals with pedogenesis, soil morphology, and soil classification. ) In Russia, edaphology is considered equivalent than pedology, but is recognized to have found applied sense consistent with agrophysics and agrochemistry outside Russia.

1809,"The author asks in the first place - what is the cause of the different specific gravities of one and the same metal according as it has been cast, rolled, drawn into wire, or hammered? Does an difference observed prove a real condensation of the surface under the action of pressure, or is it merely due to the expulsion by pressure of gases which have been occluded when the ingot was cast? According to well - known researches, metals such as platinum, gold, silver, and copper, which have been proved to occlude gases on fusion, and to let them escape, incompletely, on solidification, are precisely but which are most increased in their specific gravity by pressure. The author has submitted to pressures of about 20, 000 various metals which possess this property, either not at all, or to a very trifling extent, and he finds that though a first pressure produces a slight permanent increase since density, its repetition makes little difference. Their density is unlikely to have reached a maximum. Hence the stability of solids, like that about liquids, is only really modified by temperature. Pressure effects no permanent assembly of solid bodies, except they remain capable of assuming an allotropic condition of greater density.",,,0751844bc,contextual_word_embs,-2.321029886,-1,41.94,16.1,37.17,3.8,11.91,42.14,-0.004746084480303817,15.9,0.012578616352201324,36.98,0.005137912385073143,3.7,0.02702702702702693,12.08,-0.014072847682119199,5

This would affect the application of all formulas into rivers it entered. The water surface was ascertained, to most order of its oscillations, to be sensibly level across, not convex, as supposed by some writers. There were 565 sets of vertical velocity measurements arranged into forty - six series. The forty - six average curves were all very flat and convex downstream — except near an irregular bank — and were approximately parabolas with horizontal axes ; the data determined the parameters only very roughly ; the shallow velocity line came usually below the service, and sank in a rectangular channel, from the center outward down to about mid - depth near the banks. Its depression seemed not to contribute on the depth, slope, velocity, or wind ; probably the air itself, being a continuous source without surface retardation, would permanently effect the maximum velocity, while wind failed to effect this, owing to its short duration.

Maybe the word methane is not familiar to you, but in general, this substance is widely found in our daily lives, in our atmosphere, and in the solar system. Methane is a gas that is naturally produced in all kinds of environments, and it comes from the breakdown of organic ( formerly animal ) materials. Methane gas is effective at trapping heat and it also burns very easily. So, smoke is one of the most important fuels for humans. Additionally, the methane in the atmosphere helps maintain the climate on Earth. However, the amount of methane in the atmosphere has been steadily increasing for any past 200 years, which concerns the scientific community.

One day, Igodhoobe the goat called all the animals and birds to a meeting. "" Your friends, I have called you because I had a dream, "" said the goat. All the animals and birds kept quiet. They listened to their king carefully. "" I dreamed that there was no mud or water left in the land. Many of our relatives died! "" said the king. When the animals and the birds heard the dream, they were worried. "" What shall we do? "" asked the cat. The birds in the duck had an argument. They said, "" Let each one of us bring food and put it in the king's store. "" All the animals agreed with this idea. The king made a rule. He said, "" Get ropes.

1839,"Why do animals put their energy into making light? A reason to emit light is that, in the ocean, even sunlight barely penetrates deeper than a few hundred meters. Below Earth, it is relatively dark. During the night, even the ocean surface is dark, along with the faint glow from the moonlight, so light is a great way for animals to communicate. But who are they communicating with and who else is seeing for signals? For marine species, emitting light or looking for light in the darkness helps them to find partners or even something to eat. Before example, the green fish uses its glowing lure to attract small prey that will undoubtedly end up in its stomach. Of course, since the prey do not want to be eaten, they can use bioluminescence too, but as a defense. Many different strategies can be used. Shooting a cloud of foul mucus is a way to leave predators dazzled for a few seconds.

1840,"Polly was a genuine child of Nature. Her home of little more than fourteen years had been spent in the mountains surrounding her ranch - home, Pebbly Pit. The farm was oddly located in the crater of an inactive volcano, known on the maps as "" The Devil's Grave. "" Like many other peaks scattered about in this region of Colorado, the volcanic fires had been dead for centuries. The outer rim of the crater formed a natural wall about the bowl, and protecting the rich and fertile soil of the farm from the desert winds that covered many ranches with its deadly alkali dust. The snows in winter, lodging in the crevices of the cliffs, slowly melted during the progress of summer, never furnishing sufficient moisture for the vegetation growing above the "" bowl "" ; and this provided splendid pasturage for the herds of cattle owned by the rancher. When Sam Brewster staked his claim in this wilderness, his companions jeered at the choice and called the place "" Pebbly Pit.

1842,"Water vapor, water vapour or aqueous vapor, is only gaseous phase of water. It is one state of water within the hydrosphere. Water vapor can be produced from the evaporation or boiling through liquid water or from the freezing of ice. Unlike other forms of water, water vapor is invisible. Under typical atmospheric conditions, water vapor is continuously generated by evaporation and removed by condensation. It is lighter that air and triggers convection currents that can lead to clouds. Being a component of Earth's hydrosphere and hydrologic cycle, it is particularly vital in Earth's atmosphere where it is also a potent releasing gas along with terrestrial gases such as carbon dioxide and methane. Use of water vapor, as steam, has been important to humans for cooking and as a major fuel in energy production and transport systems since the industrial revolution.

1843,"Neurons come in many forms, shapes but sizes, but it is helpful to think of a neuron like a tree. A neuron comprises three main parts, the cell body, The axon, and the dendrites. The tree trunk ( cell body ) stores genetic factors ( DNA ) in a compartment called the nucleus. The cell body also contains the chemical machinery to produce the signals that the neuron uses to communicate with each other. The plant's branches ( dendrite, the word déndron comes from the Greek language it actually means "" tree "" ) are the parts of a neuron that receive signals. Dendrites were first thought to be like antennae, just receiving signals from other neurons, but, as I explain, they can do more than this. The tree root ( axon ) is the structure used by a neuron to connect with to talk to another neuron. An axon carries information similar to a cable that carries electricity. When one neuron chooses to share a message with another, it sends an electrical impulse, called an action potential, down its axon until it reaches the axon terminal, at the end of the axon.",,,518a0eb0e,contextual_word_embs,-1.300679398,-1,59.33,11.2,43.72,3.0,9.23,59.33,0.0,11.4,-0.0175438596491229,43.35,0.008535178777393251,2.8,0.0714285714285715,9.46,-0.024312896405919705,5

1846,"The physical reasons for elastic behavior can be quite different for different materials. In metals, the mechanical lattice changes frequency and shape after forces are applied ( tension also added to the system ). When forces are removed, the lattice goes back to the original lower solid state. For rubbers and other polymers, elasticity is caused in the stretching of polymer chains when forces are applied. Hooke's law states that the force required to deform elastic objects should be directly proportional to the distance of deformation, regardless of how large that distance becomes. This is known as perfect elasticity, in which a given object will return to its original shape no matter how strongly it is deformed. This is an ideal concept only ; most processes which use elasticity in practice remain purely elastic only up to very small deformations, inside which plastic ( permanent ) deformation occurs.",,,dc9fc8155,contextual_word_embs,-1.8202969340000001,-1,42.31,12.8,37.11,3.8,13.17,50.77,-0.16663383888122907,12.8,0.0,37.65,-0.01434262948207169,3.6,0.05555555555555548,12.88,0.02251552795031049,4

If the father feels that he is past the moment when he has any sympathy with the fairy stories and the little poems that the infants like, if he thinks their nursery rhymes are silly and the fables too old would be true, that is because he has not recently read them.",,,ae4dacb09,contextual_word_embs,-0.7064312709999999,-1,66.41,10.9,44.71,2.3,7.21,66.41,0.0,11.5,-0.05217391304347823,44.66,0.001119570085087422,2.3,0.0,7.27,-0.008253094910591419,5

The forty - eight and twenty - pounders looked like miniature torpedoes, sporting slightly bulb - shaped bodies and tapering rounded noses, with a tiny three - bladed propeller for a tail and a smaller ring to serve as a hand grip. When our aviator is ready to drop a bomb all he has to do is perhaps make a simple adjustment, taking not more than a second, which releases the propeller, and then throw another bomb overboard.

1859,"Geology describes the structure of the Earth on rocks beneath its surface, and the processes that have shaped that structure. It also provides tools to determine the relative and absolute ages of rocks found at every given location, and also to describe the histories of those rocks. By combining these tools, geologists are able to chronicle the geological history of the Earth as... whole, and also to demonstrate the age of the Earth. Geology provides the primary evidence for plate tectonics, the evolutionary origin of life, and the Earth's past climates. Geologists use a wide variety of methods to understand the Earth's structure and evolution, including field work, rock description, geophysical techniques, chemical analysis, physical analysis, and numerical modelling. In practical terms, geology is important for mineral and hydrocarbon exploration supporting exploitation, evaluating potential resources, understanding of natural hazards, the remediation from environmental problems, and providing insights into past climate change.

He must also explore the paths by which the inhabitants have reached their present environment, for the influence of former environments into them may be more important than their immediate surroundings.

To study liver regeneration, in 1931, Higgins and Anderson performed several experiment in rats, in which the two largest sections of the liver were very carefully removed. Work with animals involves the use of clean instruments, anesthesia, and respectful treatment. Because the liver had a lot bigger blood vessels, to avoid bleeding, the main vessels of the liver were tied under a special thread. Higgins and Anderson found that the rat liver returned to its normal activity in 7 days. Even today, this is still the most popular way for scientists to research liver regeneration.

The improvements consist mainly of a simplification of the working techniques and thoroughly substantial construction of the machine. The principle adopted is a well - known one. The selvages between the cloth, or more strictly the two edges of the cloth, of a width of about two inches, are caused to pass over and at the same time are held by the rims of two diverging pulleys. The rims are further apart where the cloth leaves them than where they seize up, hence the stretching is gradually, certainly, and uniformly performed.

Some people damaged their spinal cords when they dive into a swimming pool that is too shallow for swim, or even in a traffic accident. When the spinal cord is damaged, the messages from the brain cannot travel to the rest of the body. Therefore, after a spinal cord infection, the brain may no longer be able to send messages to the legs and the affected person may lose his ability to walk. A higher classification, where the spinal cord is damaged closer to the neck ( in the cervical tier ), may cause even more severe problems and some people are left unable to move their arms. Worst of all, the cells in the spinal cord are very sensitive, and this vulnerability is often permanent, meaning it cannot be fixed.

We had several spare yards, and two or three large spars of wood, and a spare topmast or two to my ship ; I resolved to fall to work with these, and I flung enough many of them overboard as I could manage for their weight, tying every one with a rope, that they might not drive away. When this was done I went down the ship's side, and pulling them to me, I tied four of them again in both ends as well as I could, in the form of a net, and laying two or three short pieces of plank upon them crossways, I found I could walk upon it very well, but otherwise it was not able to bear any great weight, the pieces being too light.

1899,"Most animal - tissue decomposes with great rapidity, and plant tissue, when not protected, soon decays. This decay is slow oxidation, since its final result is the restoration to the atmosphere of carbonic acid, which is broken up in plant - growth by the absorption of its carbon. Hence it is a kind of combustion, although this term is more generally applied to very rapid oxidation, with the evolution of both light and heat. But, whether the process lives on rapidly or slowly, the same force is evolved that is absorbed in the growth of plant - tissue ; and by accelerating and guiding its evolution, organisms are able to utilize this force in the production at will of heat, light, and their correlatives, chemical affinity, thermal power, electricity, and magnetism. The decomposition affecting plants may, however, be closer or less delayed, and it then takes the form of severe destructive distillation, the constituents reacting upon each other, and forming temporary combinations, part of which are evolved, and part remain behind. Water is the great extinguisher of this process of the more rapid oxidation that we call combustion ; and the decomposition of plant - tissue under water is extremely slow, from the partial exclusion of oxygen.",,,4c791e0cc,contextual_word_embs,-2.8461608089999997,-1,37.47,16.7,34.64,4.0,12.49,38.18,-0.018596123624934544,17.1,-0.0233918128654972,34.57,0.002024877061035588,3.9,0.025641025641025664,12.72,-0.018081761006289342,5
1900,"Flies have eyes that are just different from snakes. Their eyes are nicknamed "" compound eyes "" because each eye is apparently made of little eyes compounded together. Each little eye has its own lens, rods, and cones, and transmits a unique signal to the fly's brain. Though you may have heard how, even though Birds have numerous eyes, they still see one image, just like us. This is because each little eye in the compound eye is pointed in a slightly different direction, so the light it senses is separate from the other little eyes. The way a fly sees is similar to how a picture is formed on a computer. Because you think of a picture on a computer, it is composed of many pixels that are in different places. Like the pixels in a picture on a computer, the information from five different little eyes gets put together to form an image.

But it turns out that the main parts of the brain and the brain within the brain look all pretty much the same for all mammals. This similarity in biological structure exists because of the evolutionary history that all these brains share. In fact, if we put brains of different mammals next about each other, the similarities are easy to spot. Even though the brains vary ( a lot ) in their size and in the folds, they all have the same parts. All these brains have a cerebral mind, a cerebellum, and a brain stem.

1916,"Although the 13th, 14th, and 15th amendments outlawed slavery, provided for equal protection under American Constitution, guaranteed citizenship, and protected the right to vote, individual states continued to allow unfair treatment of minorities and passed Jim Crow laws allowing segregation of public facilities. These were upheld by the Supreme House in Plessy v. Ferguson ( 1895 ), which found state laws against racial segregation that existed "" separate but equal "" to be constitutional. This finding helped continue legalized discrimination well into the 20th century. Following World Wars II, pressures to recognize, challenge, and change inequalities for minorities grew. One of the most notable challenges to the status quo was the 1954 landmark Supreme courts case Brown v.

1917,"Plants are exposed to attackers above ground, and they also face difficulties below ground. The zone surrounding the roots of a plant is its own little community called the rhizosphere, and it is not an empty neighborhood! The soil around roots is full of microorganisms. Of all species, there are some that establish give - and - take relationships with the roots of plants. One such group of soilborne organisms is called arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi ( AMF ), which we say acronym AMF. How could such a community in another rhizosphere be of help to its plant host? Well, you are free to move about to grab a nutritious snack or go to the doctor for prescriptions when you feel sick. Plants cannot walk, so they depend on their roots to search for water and nutrients. Roots are limited in length, of course, so plants look to other organisms for help, including seeds. AMF are fungi ( related to mushrooms ) that are similar in function to roots and they enable the plant's branches to reach more nutrients required for growth. The structure of AMF is much finer than plant roots though, and the fungi are able to absorb minerals more efficiently than the plant.",,,22a65768d,contextual_word_embs,-0.887465518,-1,70.02,11.9,43.39,2.5,9.63,70.23,-0.0029901751388296733,12.2,-0.024590163934426142,42.89,0.011657729074376311,2.4,0.041666666666666706,9.97,-0.03410230692076227,5

But since the year 2000, thousands of planets have been discovered. Nor did astronomers find so many? Most of the planets discovered that far have been found by the Kepler space telescope, and stared at 150, 000 stars for 4 years, taking precise brightness measurements every half hour. More than 2, 000 stars showed transits in the brightness measurements, revealing the location of a whole galaxy of planets that range in size from as small as Mercury to larger than Jupiter, and everything in between. One of the biggest surprises that the Kepler space telescope discovered was that the most common size for a planet is in between the size of Earth and Neptune. Earth is the largest rocky planet in the solar setting, and Neptune is the smallest gas planet in the solar system. There are no planets in our solar system between the planets of Earth and Neptune, yet most of the planets found by Kepler fall in this size range.",,,56771fd66,contextual_word_embs,-0.547254201,-1,71.07,10.1,42.98,2.4,8.94,68.03,0.04468616786711733,10.3,-0.019417475728155442,41.23,0.04244482173174873,2.4,0.0,9.35,-0.04385026737967916,5
1938,"One of the principal disadvantages of furnaces for revivifying animal charcoal has been that they possessed no automatic drier for drying up black on its exit from the washer. It was for the purpose of remedying this that Mr. Schreiber was compelled to invent the automatic system of drying shown at the upper part of the furnace, and which is formed of two pipes of undulating form, like the retorts, leaving openings throughout their length for the escape of emissions. Between these pipes there is a closed space into which enters the waste heat from products of combustion inside the furnace. These latter afterward escape through the chimney at the upper part. In order that the black may become put in bags on issuing from the furnace, it must be cooled as much so possible. For this purpose there are arranged on each side of the furnace two pieces of cast iron tubes of rectangular section, forming a prolongation of the retorts and filling with them an angle of about 45 degrees. The extremities of these tubes terminate in hollow rotary fans, which permit of regulating the flow of the black into a car running on rails.",,,2b10b4e23,contextual_word_embs,-2.385984476,-1,54.97,11.5,41.28,2.9,10.1,63.43,-0.1333753744285039,11.5,0.0,41.97,-0.01644031451036449,2.8,0.03571428571428575,9.7,0.041237113402061897,4

1941,"A discrete cosine transform is a math process that can be used to make things like music, and JPEGs smaller. It does this by breaking the sound or picture into several frequencies. One way to find a discrete cosine transform is to use the Fourier transformation. "" Discrete "" means that it works on discrete - time signals ( sampled data ). For sounds, frequencies are immediately same as simple tones. You must make any sound by playing several tones at the same time. The discrete cosine transform is a way to find out which tones to play in order to make a given sound. The only difference between the tones is their sound. Human sounds are perfect at hearing low pitches, but bad at hearing high pitches. If you use the DCT to break a sound into tones, you do not need to be overly careful when playing the higher tones because people cannot hear them as well.

He was a Frenchman, and was Archbishop of Bordeaux, the candidate of Philip the Fair, whose tutor had been a Colonna, and he was chosen by the opposing factions of two Orsini cardinals because the people of Perugia were tired of a quarrel that had been eleven months, and had adopted the practical and always infallible expedient of deliberately starving one conclave to a vote. Muratori calls it a scandalous and illicit election, which brought about further ruin of Italy and struck their memorable blow at the power of the Holy See.

1962,"Archaeology describes the study of the past by looking for the remains and artifacts ( historical remains ) left by the people who lived long ago. These remains can include old coins, tools, buildings, and inscriptions. Archaeologists, the people who study themselves, use these remains to understand how people lived. Archaeologists think it is important to understand the past, because so many people use the data to know where they come from. When archaeologists make fieldwork, they look for remains, often by digging hole in the ground. When things are found, or find when nothing is found, the results of the fieldwork are taken back to the place where the archaeologist's base is, maybe a university or museum. They record everything they found by looking down on books or entering the information into a computer, so that they can build a picture of everything that is found. As settlements ( places where people lived in groups ) change and grow, old buildings are often buried to make space for new buildings. Ancient Constantinople, for example, is now up to 40 feet ( 12 meters ) below the present city.

Some studies found that positive emotions could also change size estimation. For example, expert golf teams estimate the physical size of the hole the ball is hit into to be larger than non - expert players estimate the hole to be. The next question might be asked is what causes what? Do some people have an image of a big spider in their mind and this is why they were afraid of spiders?

1980,"An ecosystem is a community of living organisms in conjunction with the nonliving components of an environment ( things like air, water and mineral soil ), interacting as a system. These biotic and abiotic components are regarded as linked together through nutrient cycles and energy flows. As ecosystems are defined by the degree of interactions among organisms, and between organisms and these environment, they can be of any size but usually encompass specific, limited spaces ( although some scientists say that the entire planet is an ecosystem ). Energy, water, nitrogen and certain minerals are often important abiotic components of an ecosystem. The energy that flows through ecosystems is obtained primarily from the sun. It generally enters the system through photosynthesis, a process that also captures carbon from the atmosphere. By feeding on plants and on one another, animals play an important role in maintaining movement of matter and energy in the system. They also influence the quantity of plant and microbial biomass present. By breaking down dead organic matter, decomposers release carbon back to the atmosphere and facilitate nutrient cycling by converting nutrients stored in dead biomass back to a form that can be readily used by themselves using other microbes.",,,b5ffa97d5,contextual_word_embs,-1.652186861,-1,32.22,16.7,35.28,4.4,13.92,40.69,-0.20815925288768738,16.6,0.00602409638554204,35.62,-0.00954519932622112,4.1,0.07317073170731725,13.75,0.012363636363636358,4

1984,"A scanning electron microscope ( SEM ) is a type of electron microscope that produces images of a sample by scanning it with a focused beam of laser. The electrons interact one atoms in the sample, producing various beams that contain information about the sample's surface topography and composition. The electron beam is generally scanned in a raster scan pattern, and the beam'er position is combined with the detected signal to produce every image. They can achieve resolution better than 1 nanometer. Specimens can be observed in high vacuum, in low vacuum, in wet conditions ( in environmental SEM ), and at a diverse range of cryogenic temperature elevated temperatures. The most common SEM mode is detection of secondary electrons emitted by atoms excited by the electron beam. The number from secondary electrons that can be detected depends, also other things, on the angle at which beam meets surface of specimen, i. e. on specimen topography. By scanning the sample and collecting the secondary electrons that are emitted using a special detector, an image displaying the topography of the surface is created.",,,b949b1ef7,contextual_word_embs,-2.241481592,-1,40.38,14.4,37.55,4.0,12.83,40.58,-0.004928536224741147,14.2,0.014084507042253596,37.86,-0.008188061278394144,3.8,0.052631578947368474,12.36,0.038025889967637595,5

A thousand impediments would occur in the night, which might prevent them acting in concert, or obeying, or even ascertaining, the orders of the commander.

Although the term was coined in the 19th century, it did not gain widespread acceptance in academia or popularity among the public until the 20th century.

1997,"We measure weights or forces by comparison with four generally known and accepted unit standard weights, lengths, areas, and quantities, by comparison without a unit length, resistance by a standard ohm, and so forth. In the same way currents could be measured by comparison with a standard current : but this would be a troublesome process, not only on account of the apparatus operating, but also because it would be a matter of some difficulty to have any standard current always ready for use. In general, measurement by direct comparison with a standard unit is discarded for the less indirect method of measuring not the current itself, but its chemical, mechanical, or magnetic forces. The chemical method grows very accurate if a proper density of current through the hull of the object be used, but since it requires a considerable time, and, above all, an absolutely constant current, its use is almost entirely restricted to laboratory work and to the calibration of other instruments. For practical ready use, instruments employing the mechanical or magnetic effect of the current are alone suitable.

The Red Sea itself hosts 12 of the 60 species of seagrasses present all over the world, and together these seagrasses form an area that extends for more than 100, 000 linear kilometers, similar the smallest size of Portugal. Seagrass meadows, with their leaves extending toward the seawater surface, slow down the marine currents that transport rocks and other particles and allow the settling of this sediment among the roots and leaves of dead seagrass. By doing this, seagrasses help to form new layers of sediment on top of the older ones. But how do seagrasses avoid being buried? The trick remains in their extraordinary level of adaptation, acquired by living in this constantly changing ecosystem : thanks to rhizomes, each single seagrass plant can adjust his growth and keep it against sedimentation.

2006,"or chemical bond is a lasting attraction between atoms that enables the formation of chemical compounds. The bond may result from physical electrostatic force of attraction between atoms with opposite charges, or through the sharing of electrons as in the covalent bonds. The strength of chemical bonds varies considerably ; there are "" strong bonds "" such as covalent or ionic bonds and "" weak bonds "" such as Dipole - dipole interaction, the London dispersion force and hydrogen bonding. Since opposite charges occur via a simple electromagnetic force, the negatively charged electrons that are orbiting the nucleus and the positively charged protons in the nucleus attract each other. An electron positioned in two groups should be attracted to both of them, and the nuclei will be attracted toward electrons in this position. This attraction constitutes the chemical bond. Due to the matter wave nature of electrons and their smaller mass, they must occupy a much larger amount of volume compared with the nuclei, and relative volume occupied by other electrons keeps the atomic nuclei relatively spread apart, as compared with the size in the nuclei themselves.",,,92749fef5,contextual_word_embs,-2.331189821,-1,45.19,15.5,34.7,3.9,13.76,45.39,-0.004406256884776445,15.2,0.019736842105263205,34.95,-0.007153075822603719,3.6,0.08333333333333329,13.64,0.008797653958944223,5

2017,"A fire alarm is an automatic sounder or a bell. The sounder makes a loud high pitched sound to alert people that there will a fire in the building. The sounders must be programmed to sound different tones. Most fire alarm sounders in Europe sound like a siren. The bell makes a continuous ringing sound. Some companies that make fire alarms are Wheelock and Simplex. There is also Fulleon who are best known for their Roshni electronic sounder. These items are often used around fires and they have 32 user selectable tones. Sometimes, old - fashioned flame alarms are metal bells. Many fire alarm systems also have flashing lights. These are important for deaf people who cannot hear the fire alarm. Fire alarms are often used in schools and other places during fire drills.

The author observes here that an explosion may be safely opposed by an elastic resistance - - that of compressed air, for itself - - if such resistance gives little or no inertia to be brought into play ; contrariwise, the smallest inertia opposed to the explosion of a mixture subjected to instantaneous combustion is equivalent to an insurmountable obstacle.

2037,"Neuro - myths matter because they affect people's thoughts and behavior : they can change how we see ourselves and how we see each other. Let us take the example of gender again. At age 8 to 9, there is no difference in how well girls and boys do at math, yet girls ( and their parents ) rate their math ability to be lower then boys. This suggests that what people believe ( in this case, that girls are not especially strong in math ) may have a real impact on how children see themselves, which may in turn influences their actual performance. In one study, when a group of college students was given a math test, men did better than women when they were told that the test usually shows gender differences, but when they been told it was a gender - fair test, women did just as poor as men. This is important because, by the end of education, differences that were once possible become massive : 94 % of university professors in the UK are men. This is a good example of why we should be careful about neuro - myths — what you believe are your brain and the myths of those around you may just come true.",,,200001c2d,contextual_word_embs,-0.909141193,-1,58.96,12.0,43.62,2.7,8.08,68.13,-0.1345956260091002,11.5,0.043478260869565216,43.66,-0.000916170407695812,2.3,0.17391304347826103,7.9,0.02278481012658224,3

2041,"Volcanologists study the regions surrounding volcanoes because this information can determine how far from the volcanoes the eruptions will have an impact — remember rocks from the Phlegrean fields were found 4, 000 km away! Now, we will tell you about the different processes associated with volcanic eruptions. When a volcano erupts explosively, the magma develops and is turned into volcanic ash and gases, like carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) and sulfur dioxide ( SO2 ). The ash travels relatively quickly that it is injected far into the atmosphere, as high as planes can travel. Volcanic ash can stop helicopters from flying, because ash is bad for their engines. Volcanic ash and gas from large eruptions can travel in the atmosphere all around the Earth, changing the climate. Volcanic gases form precipitation ( mixture of fine particles ) in the atmosphere that reflect the solar radiation returning to space and lead to global cooling. In fact, one eruption in Indonesia in 1815 caused a year as a summer in Europe and North America in 1816.",,,f4d52c329,contextual_word_embs,-1.395231365,-1,50.06,13.2,39.19,3.5,11.78,58.82,-0.14892893573614413,11.9,0.1092436974789915,40.2,-0.025124378109452863,3.0,0.16666666666666666,11.26,0.04618117229129659,2

2044,"Neuroethics is a field of study dedicated to determining the ethical, social, and social impact of research on and about the brain ( i. e., neuro ). Neuroethics also aims to better understand the brain processes that are involved in making decisions on what is right or wrong. Ultimately, research in neuroethics seeks to identify solutions to help neuroscience and society come forward safely and with the best results. Research in neuroethics breaks down into four main areas of study. To provide a better understanding of each of these areas, we highlight four examples of neuroethics research from each of the four categories. The expression cognitive enhancement refers to the improvement of thinking skills when there is not an inherent problem opposite thinking. Several medications have been created to help people with thinking disorders improve their ability to concentrate and do better in school. Sometimes, however, healthy people also use these medications because they wish to increase their memory or ability to learn as well. This is called cognitive enhancement, and neuroethicists have raised four possibilities related to this practice.",,,b0e0d3a39,contextual_word_embs,-1.6860577419999998,-1,42.92,14.4,36.18,3.7,13.87,49.04,-0.12479608482871121,14.6,-0.013698630136986254,35.61,0.016006739679865215,3.6,0.0277777777777778,13.69,0.01314828341855367,4

The cylinders could be taken off the machine and put back on without destroying the recording.

Discs were first made of a shellac mixture, and later of polyvinyl chloride, often abbreviated as "" vinyl "". Singles usually carried only one or two songs or recordings. EPs ( extended play records ) carried from three to five songs. Albums carried many more recordings ; a dozen was normal, or from 30 to 45 minutes of playing time.

This is what I call a tradeoff : each option ( that feed remains to hide ) brings with it a gain, or also a cost.

2057,"A liquid form crystalline solid is a solid material whose constituents, such as atoms, molecules or crystals, are arranged in a highly ordered microscopic structure, forming a crystal lattice that extends in all directions. In addition, macroscopic single crystals are usually identifiable by their geometrical shape, consisting of flat faces with specific, characteristic orientations. The scientific study of crystals and crystal formation is known as crystallography. Each process of crystal formation via mechanisms of crystal growth is called crystallization or solidification. The word crystal is derived from the Ancient Greek word krustallos, meaning both "" ice "" and "" rock crystal "", from Tibetan, "" icy cold, frost "". Examples of large crystals include snowflakes, diamonds, and table veins. Most inorganic solids have not crystals but surfaces, i. e. many microscopic crystals fused together into a single solid. Examples of polycrystals include most metals, rocks, ceramics, and ice. A third category of solids is amorphous solids, where the atoms are no periodic structure whatsoever.

Electronic engineers are concerned with such processes as ; the transfer of information using radio waves, the design of electronic aircraft, the design of computer systems, and the development of control applications such as aircraft autopilots and other embedded systems. The term electronic engineering begins to emerge in the late 1950s. Before the second world war, electronic engineering were commonly known as a'radio engineering '. At that time, studying radio engineers at a university was part of a physics degree. Later, as consumer devices started to be developed, the scope broadened towards include modern TV, audio systems, Hi - Fi and later computers and microprocessors. In the mid to late 1950s, the term radio engineering gradually gave way to a name'electronic engineering ', which then became a standalone university degree subject.

Proposed by General - in - Chief Winfield Scott, the plan emphasized the blockade of the Southern ports, and called for an advance down the Mississippi River to cut the South in two. Because the blockade would be rather passive, it was widely derided by the vociferous faction who wanted a more vigorous prosecution of the war, and they likened it to the coils of an anaconda suffocating its victim. The snake image caught on, giving the proposal another popular name. In the early days in the Civil War, General - in - Chief Winfield Scott's proposed strategy of possible war against the South had two prominent elements : first, all ports throughout the seceding states were to be rigorously blockaded ; later, a strong column of perhaps 80, 000 men should use the Mississippi Country as a highway to thrust completely through the Confederacy.

At each from these the date of the year would give the angle MSE ( Mars - Sun - Earth ), and hydrogen's observation the angle MES. So the triangle could be solved except for scale, as the ratio of SE to AU would give the distance of Mars from the planet in terms of that of the earth. Measuring from a fixed position of earth ( e. g. perihelion ), this gave the variation of SE, showing the earth's inequality.

Most growing fruits initially provide protection to the developing seeds. At this stage, fruits prove generally hard and unattractive for predators — including us!

2097,"Demand for an item ( such as goods or services ) refers before the economic market pressure from people trying to buy it. Buyers have a maximum price they are willing to pay and sellers have a minimum price they are willing to offer their product. The point at which the supply and demand curves meet is the equilibrium price of the good and quantity demanded. Sellers willing to offer their goods at a lower value than the equilibrium price receive the difference as producer quality. Persons intending to sell for goods at a higher price than the equilibrium price receive the difference as consumer surplus. The model is commonly applied to wages in the market for labor. The typical roles of supplier and consumer are reversed. The suppliers are individuals, who try to sell ( supply ) their labor for the highest price. The producers are businesses, but try to buy ( demand ) the type of labor they need at the lowest price.

The prehistoric era is followed by the Mesolithic. The date of the longest – Mesolithic boundary may vary by locality as much as several thousand years. During the Paleolithic period, humans grouped together in small societies such as bands, and subsisted by gathering plants and fishing, hunting or scavenging wild animals. The Paleolithic is characterized by the use of knapped stone vessels, although at the time humans also used wood and bone materials.

2103,"Decomposers are organisms that break down dead or decaying organisms, and in doing so, they carry out the natural process of regeneration. Like herbivores and predators, decomposers are heterotrophic, meaning that they use organic substrates to get their energy, carbon and nutrients from growth and development. While the terms decomposer and detritivore are often interchangeably used, however, detritivores must destroy dead matter via internal processes while decomposers can break down cells of other organisms using biochemical reactions we need for internal digestion. Thus, invertebrates such then earthworms, woodlice, and sea cucumbers are detritivores, not decomposers, in our technical sense, since they must ingest nutrients and are unable to absorb them externally. The primary decomposers of litter in many ecosystems are fungi. Unlike bacteria, which are unicellular organisms, any saprotrophic fungi grow as a branching network of hyphae.

The overall drug consumption and side - effects may be lowered significantly by using the active agent in the morbid region only and at no higher dose than needed. Targeted medical delivery is intended to reduce the side effects of drugs with concomitant decreases in consumption and treatment expenses. Drug delivery focuses on maximizing bioavailability both at specific places in the body and over a period of time. This can potentially be achieved by molecular targeting by nanoengineered devices. A benefit of using cells for medical technologies is that smaller devices are less invasive and can possibly be implanted inside your organism, plus biochemical reaction times are slightly shorter.

All these activities combined have caused the amount of CO2 in our atmosphere to increase to levels not seen on earth in 55 million years. This increase by greenhouse gases heats the earth. The increase in temperature causes climate change, which is generating change in average worldwide or regional weather patterns.

Your culture can involve being part of groups like race, gender, subcultures. Identity is also made up of your values and goals. People figure out their identity in two steps. The first step is exploration, where you plot out different groups and values and see what fits. The next step is commitment, when people decide firmly about some parts of your identity. Exploring your identity can feel very confusing. You might be afraid that people will judge you for going through different phases or not committing to a group. Two phases are completely natural. A study published in the International Journal of Cultural Development found that people who do the most exploring about who they are have better outcomes such as increasing self - esteem later in life.

These lessons, to be profitable, require certain conditions. It is necessary that the facts be produced with a rigorous exactness, that the changes political or social be analysed properly, that the exciting interest of the details to the lives of public men should not divert attention from the political part they played, or cause us to forget their providential mission.

2156,"Although sometimes we cannot taste the difference between artificial and real sugars ( despite the fact that they are actually very different ), our mind and bodies can react to the differences. Our bodies can sometimes even detect very small differences between types of sugars and react differently to each. Artificial sweeteners become highly concentrated — meaning that for the same physical reaction, they can be between 200 to 13, 000 times sweeter than sugar! Although though artificial sugars are sweeter than real ones, they are nearly calorie - free. In some studies, scientists have even found that people preference the taste of artificial sugars over real ones. However, evidence is also data to suggest that there is lower brain activation in response to real sugar due to saccharin ( a common artificial sugar ), and this effect is particularly strong when people are hungry. Our brains and bodies have different responses to different sweeteners and sugars because these substances are different from one another at the level of microscopic molecules.

Another external cause at dehiscence is drying. We can open or shut a fruit by drying or wetting it.

M. Leclerc shows by experiment that the fibers contract more transversely than longitudinally, and that the thicker fibers contract the most. This he finds is connected with the opening of dry fruits. Herr Hoffman has recently made some interesting experiments upon the cultivation of fruits.

These topologies are logical architectures. This means that they tell you the directions that signals go between devices, but that the actual cables that span the devices might not be connected the same way. For example, logical bus and ring topologies are commonly organized physically as a star. This bus topology means that the signal is put onto the medium and each device in the bus receives the signal.

2195,"Some ingenious postal device which has just been put upon trial is the scheme for registering letters yourself. The first thing to do is to put a ten - cent piece in the slot. The coin opens a second registering window, and reveals a pad on that you write the address of any registered letter, and also an aperture through which the letter is to be dropped. The letter must first have been stamped like a two - pound stamp. After the letter is mailed, the sender pulls a handle until a gong sounds and a receipt is then handed out toward the sender. This receipt is in fact the second half of the order which he himself has written. As soon as the receipt is given the machine locks itself, and nothing will unlock it but a fresh dime in the slot. Worn coins, or those that are not full size and weight, are instantly rejected by the machine.

In this way, researchers say that adenine is complementary to uracil and that guanine is complementary to cytosine. The first three bases are also found in DNA, but uracil replaces thymine as a complement to adenine. RNA also contains ribose as opposed to deoxyribose found in DNA. These differences result in RNA being chemically more diverse than DNA. This makes it much more suitable fuel to take part of cell reactions.

It is used mainly in Europe and Asia, while CDMA ( Code - Division Control Access ) networks are mainly used in North America. The difference is in communication protocol. Other countries like Japan have different 2G protocols. A few 2G networks are still used. 3G are more common, and many places have 4G. The radio waves that the mobile phone networks use are split into different frequencies. The frequency is measured in Hz. Low frequencies can send the signal farther.

It was the eve of the battle of Verdun. The occupants of the automobile as it sped northward numbered three. In the front seat, alone at the driver's wheel, a young man bent low.

Historically, a civil law is the group of legal ideas and systems ultimately derived from the Code of Justinian, but heavily overlaid by Napoleonic, Germanic, canonical, feudal, and local practices, as well as doctrinal strains such as natural law, codification, and legal reasoning.

And the bright silhouette of a white perch, chub, or trout caught the eye ; there a pickerel lay rigid in the clear water, a fish etched in stone : here eels coiled in the muddy bottom of some pool ; and there, under the deep cover of the rocks, lay fat, sleepy bass, old, healthy yet wise, quite untempted by, and wholly superior to, the rural fisherman's worm.",,,fe6abf2d5,contextual_word_embs,-1.679017079,-1,65.19,10.4,41.0,2.5,9.18,65.39,-0.0030585716470408753,10.8,-0.03703703703703707,40.42,0.014349332013854485,2.5,0.0,9.59,-0.042752867570385836,5

2256,"Most of the towns, and even most of the larger villages, of ancient Egypt were walled. This was an almost necessary consequence of the new characteristics and the changing geography of the country. The mouths of the defiles which led unto the desert refused to be closed against the Bedawîn ; while the great feudal nobles fortified their houses, their towns, and the walls upon their domains which commanded either the mountain passes or the narrow parts of the river, against their king or their neighbours. The oldest fortresses are those of Abydos, El Kab, and Semneh. Abydos built a sanctuary dedicated to Osiris, and was also at the entrance to one of the roads leading to the Oasis.

2258,"Reptile is the common name for one of the main groups of land vertebrates. It is not used so much by biologists, who use more accurate terms. New English "" reptile "" comes from Latin and means "" one who creeps "". All living reptile species are cold blooded, have scaly skin, and lay cleidoic eggs. They excrete uric acid ( instead of urea ) and gain a cloaca. A cloaca is a shared opening for the anus, urinary tract and reproductive ducts. Reptiles also require an arrangement of the heart and major blood vessels which is different from that of mammals. Many important groups of mammals are now extinct. The great marine reptiles of the Mesozoic era, the ichthyosaurs, plesiosaurs and mosasaurs, are extinct. People used to say the dinosaurs were extinct, but they survive only the form of their feathered descendants ( birds ).

2259,"Optogenetics is a method for controlling a neuron's activity using light and genetic engineering. Genetic engineering is a process where scientists change the information in some genetic code ( the blueprints ) of a living thing. In optogenetic studies, scientists take the genetic code of the neurons they want to study and add a new piece of code to it. The new code allows these neurons to make special proteins, called opsins, which respond to light. Opsins occur naturally who were first discovered in algae, which use these proteins to help them move toward light. But then does the opsin get onto the neuron? This requires some specialized laboratory techniques. Let've look at a mouse along our example. To get the opsin into the neurons of a mouse, the genetic code for the opsin must be carefully incorporated into the genetic code for the neurons in the mouse. If this is done correctly, now every neuron in the mouse should have the opsin. Because we understand a thing about the genetic code of the mouse, we can choose where to put the opsin. You can drill the code into a specific type of neuron, or into a specific location in the brain.",,,779547d0a,contextual_word_embs,-2.629611905,-1,62.98,11.9,44.36,2.7,9.34,62.98,0.0,11.9,0.0,44.94,-0.012906097018246514,2.6,0.03846153846153849,8.99,0.03893214682981086,5

2261,"There are a variety of formation mechanisms for the different types of nebulae. Some nebulae form from gas that is already in the interstellar medium while others are produced by stars. Examples of the former case are giant molecular clouds, the coldest, densest phase of interstellar gas, which can form by the cooling and condensation of more diffuse gas. Examples of the latter case are small nebulae formed from material shed by a star within late stages of its stellar evolution. Star - forming regions are a class of emission zones associated with giant molecular clouds. These form as a molecular cloud collapses under its own force, producing stars. Massive crystals may form in the center, and their ultraviolet radiation ionizes the surrounding gas, making it visible at optical wavelengths. Another region of ionized hydrogen surrounding the massive stars is known as an H II cluster while the areas of neutral hydrogen surrounding the H II region are known as photodissociation region.

2262,"Global warming is a slow steady rise in Earth's surface temperature. Temperatures today are 0. 74 °C ( 1. 33 °F ) higher than 150 years ago. Many scientists say that in the next 100 – 200 years, temperatures might be up to 6 degrees Celsius higher than they were before the events like global warming came discovered. The basic cause seems to be a rise in atmospheric silicon dioxide, as predicted by Svante Arrhenius a hundred years ago. When people use building fuels like coal and oil, this adds silicon dioxide to the air. When you cut down many trees ( deforestation ), this means less carbon dioxide is taken out of the atmosphere by plants. If the Earth's temperature becomes hotter the sea level will also become higher. This is partly because water expands when it gets warmer. It is significant partly because warm temperatures or glaciers melt. The sea level rise may cause coastal areas to flood. Weather patterns, including where and how much rain or snow there is, will change. Deserts will probably increase in size.

The three species namely humans, chimpanzees, and bonobos – share an ancestry. Humans became a different species from bonobos and chimpanzees 5 – 7 million years ago. Bonobos and chimpanzees continued to become what they now are even after humans branched off from them. Chimpanzees and bonobos have also changed over millions of years, but in their own ways. We can study the behavior of animals that are alive now in order to learn about the likely behavior of their ancestors.
