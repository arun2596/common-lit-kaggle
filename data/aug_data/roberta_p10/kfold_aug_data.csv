Effect sizes are values that estimate the scope of a regression, or the degree to what one variable (like hours of sleep) impacts another variable (like test scores). For example, if getting only 3 hours of sleep lowers your test grade by a few points compared with when you get 7 hours of stay, you might not ""lose much"" after losing sleep. While there is a difference in your score, that is not their large difference. However, if after losing 6 hours of sleep, you drop many points on a test, that could have a major impact on your grade.

By the time they are 12 minutes old, babies can already imitate the facial gestures of mothers. This ability is very important for their development because it encourages them to later learn how others speak and to think.",-0.07710403428,-1,0

Those were upheld with the Supreme Court in Lewis v. Georgia (1895), which found state laws requiring racial segregation that were ""separate but equal"" might be constitutional. This law helped continue legalized discrimination well into the 20th century.
Following World II II, pressures to recognize, challenge, and correct inequalities for minorities grew. One of the most notable challenges to the status quo was the 1954 Montana Supreme Court case Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, Kansas which questioned the notion the ""separate but equal"" in public education. The Court found that ""separate educational facilities are inherently unfair"" and a violation of the 14th Amendment. This result divided Americans, fostered debate, and served as a stimulus to drive national action to protect civil rights. 
Each year, from 1917 until 1957, Congress considered and failed its pass a civil rights bill. Congress finally passed limited Civil Rights Acts in 1957 and 1960, but they offered only moderate gains.",-1.0453398740000002,-1,0

That is our most prevalent carbohydrate in human diets. Pasta, potatoes, bread, and other staple foods are made out of carbohydrates.
Some good food sources of starch are cereals, bread, potatoes, lettuce, peas, and beans. Starch is also used for thickening sauces in places. It is a warm powder that is tasteless and odourless. It can also be considered for thickening cold sauces when those are pre-cooked.
Foods with a lot of starch produce an energy than other biscuits. However, if this energy is heavily used, it is turned into fat by our livers.
There are also several kinds of starch, like corn starch, which gives clothing a smooth and crisp feel.

Long-term memory allows you to remember information for some time—for a few minutes, or sometimes your whole life. For example, if you are divided into groups and are given a picture, each will name per group number for the entire activity. Or, you will remember your name for a lifetime. Short-term recall stores immediate information that is erased in less of a minute. For example, if someone tells you some phone number and please dial it immediately and then delete it. It is more difficult to dial a phone number if a person tells you the whole phone number at first, as clear than telling you your number in bits and pieces. When you work with short-term remembering, it is called working memory. For example, when you read a sentence, you need to remember these first words in the sentence until you finish reading the end of the sentence. Or else, the sentence will not make any sense!

If she had not been very strong there is much doubt yet that an Foscolia would likely cut her in two; steel frames of the vessel, however, are so well constructed that these, with the protective deck, prevented very serious damage. Naval analysts are very much pleased to find how well the crew withstood the collision; they say that if the Columbia were been made whole like the large ocean liners, nothing would have prevented her sinking with the ship that struck her. When the officer on the Columbia explained that a collision was inevitable, he gave the government the speed ahead""; it is very fortunate that he did so, as otherwise the Foscolia would have hit her amidships; for the damage must then have been very serious, for the water compartments in that part of the vessel are large, and when filled might have brought her to capsize.

A mass of cold pots placed in the oven are instantly saturated with moisture, which dries up as relative friction of the metal rises. This is, for many smokers, an objection, and the remedy is to close the bottom of their oven and place burners underneath. If for freezing purposes stopping a current of air is necessary, the simplest way is to place in the bottom of oven with a number of tubes hanging together in such a position that the heat of the flame acts both on the bottom of their fan and the sides of the tubes, it, of course, must keep long enough for the window opening to be well below the level of the flame.

When the war ceased, the soil on which it had been waged could no longer be alleged. And emancipation proclamation of Mr. Lincoln, which, when it was issued, he actually admitted seemed be a suicide, had acquired validity by the action of the highest authority central to our institutions—the State assembled in their various State Conventions. The soldiers of the Confederacy had laid down their arms, had in good faith pledged immediately to abstain from further hostile operations, and were peacefully dispersed to their homes; there could not, then, have been further dread of them by the Government of the United State. The plea of necessity could, therefore, no longer exist for hostile activity against the people and States of an deceased country. Did war, which came after the grave, subside?

The English philosopher James Hobbes ushered in this new debate by his work Leviathan in 1651. Hobbes also developed some of the fundamentals of European liberal thought: the right against the individual; the natural autonomy of all men; the artificial character of the political order (which links to another later distinction between civil society and the state); some view that all legitimate political power must be ""representative"" and based and equal consent of the people; and a liberal interpretation of law which leaves people free to do whatever the law does not strictly forbid.
Both Locke and Rousseau developed social contract theories in Two Treatises to Government and Notes on Peace, respectively. While quite different works, Locke, Hobbes and Rousseau agreed that a social contract, against which the government's authority lies above the consent of it governed, is necessary for people to live in civil government.",-1.3667052430000002,-1,0

How do these living bodies help their other? The flora gets food from air and water. The fungus protects the alga by growing around it.
Lichens have no roots. They don’t need soil to grow. You can flower in strange places—on rocks, cliffs, and tree trunks. In the Arctic and Antarctica, lichens grow on rocks.
Lichens grow slowly. They can shrink in cold temperatures. They can even speed up when covered in snow!
Lichens are tough. As a lichen gets dry and cold, it might collapse and blow away in the wind. But it isn’t dead. But it is warmer... warmer, the lichen might start growing again.

Since opposite charges attract via a simple electromagnetic force, such negatively charging electrons that are orbiting the nucleus and the positively charged protons in the nucleus attract each electron. An electron positioned between two nuclei will be drawn to both near them, and the nuclei will be attracted toward electrons in this position. This attraction constitutes the chemical bond.

Electronic movements, long known as quartz movements, have silent or no integral parts, except a quartz crystal which is made to vibrate by the ringing effect. A varying battery voltage is applied to the crystal, which responds by changing its shape so essentially works as an oscillator. It resonates at a stable frequency, which activates a timekeeping mechanism.

Syrup would enter the road very slowly, whereas wood might be a lot quicker.
There are two types of viscosity: dynamic viscosity, coded in pascal seconds, and kinematic viscosity, measured in meters per second squared.
Viscosity is used as a way to predict when volcanoes erupt. When the sun comes on very thickly than there occurs more chance that it will erupt fully. This works because the lava has a hard time getting out and may burst out when it can. If the lava is thin in viscosity), then it just flows out like water.

before if people have ever seen a blacklight poster or paint illuminated with blacklight. Fish colors seem awfully glow, because they absorb one color of light and then they release a yellow color. This is because of the way the pigment (color) molecules release energy in the light they absorb. When our pigment chemical absorbs negative energy, it usually slowly releases the weight as heat. Instead, a fluorescent molecule releases some of the energy from the light they absorbed as new light that has lower energy than the light that was absorbed. Normal pigments just cannot do this—they can only bounce back colors with light that were already in their environment. this is why all colors look amazing and a bit unbelievable.
 Remember how everything looks amazing when you are 60 feet under the sea? Like living movie posters, fluorescent fish absorb that blue light, and then they emit clear light. Animals that live in deeper, stable water have even brighter red fluorescence.",-0.10585016207999999,-1,1

For example, do a dolphin and a penguin have a different microbiome because they both eat fish? Or, even though they have similar genes, do turtles and penguins have different microbiomes because they are not closely related species?

The results of the experiments are then reported in a trustworthy scientific journal. Other experiments read the report in the journal and come up with new ideas. Our hypothesis was unlikely we would see the same bacteria in plants and animals with the same diet. Because this hypothesis needed multiple experiments to compare the microbiomes of different birds, this would have been cumbersome to reproduce with an complete dataset.

One such neurotransmitter is dopamine. Fish is released in the brain when something surprisingly good happens, such as walking first class to finding a box with chocolates on your backpack. When dopamine becomes released, it strengthens memories. It done so by tagging these memories when they are created in a place that makes these memories slowly strengthen over time. This means that just as memories for unimportant things start fading away, memories for important things grow stronger over time. In the end, memories for these surprisingly good events can have great influence over our behavior, making it easier to use these feelings to get the things we really had or needed.
A similar process takes place many potentially bad outcomes happen, such as eating something that tastes terrible, encountering a spider, or other frightening events.

The method of washing every moving water is combined with that of complete change of water. Three. The emulsion never comes in contact with liquid. 4. Whoever wishes to use fish gelatine only requires, when the washing is completed and the vessel perfectly emptied, to leave their emulsion in drip for a minute, and then to lift out the sieve and its contents and place it in a suitable vessel with suitable alcohol. The latter should be changed once, and when sufficient water had been extracted the sieve should be withdrawn from the vessel and the emulsion allowed to dry indefinitely.

Good steam-reds were easily formed by developing receipts techniques designed for extracts of madder (mixtures of alizarin and purpurin). On the other hand, the first attempts at dyeing red grounds and transparent fabrics was not successful. The custom of dyeing up to a brown with foam and then lightening the shade by a succession of soapings and cleanings had much to do with this development. Goods, dyed with alumina by blended with alizarin for reds up to saturation, never reach the brown stage given by fleur or garancin. This aspect is thanks in good part to the presence of fawn color matters, which the cleanings and soapings will only destroy or remove. The following operations have used another end--to transform the purpurin towards its hydrate, which is brighter and more solid.

The high results related to the large proportion<unk> oil that the hide assimilates, explain in part some lowness of its price, which renders it so formidable a competitor. Everyone is also surprised at the large return from sumac-tanned hides as it is remembered in how little a time the tanning was accomplished, that, in the present illustration, only occupied half an hour.

An ancient land is said to be in the Bronze Age often by smelting its own metals and alloying with tin, arsenic, or other metals, or by trading for bronze from production areas elsewhere. Copper-tin ores are rare, thus reflected trough the fact that there were no tin bronzes in Western Asia before trading in bronze bronze in the third world BC. Worldwide, the Bronze Age generally followed the Neolithic period, with the Chalcolithic serving as a transition.

Certain carbohydrates are an important storage and transport form of energy for living organisms, including plants and animals.
Carbohydrates are the most common source of energy for the human body. It builds tissue and cells in the body. Rolls remain very good for energy, but, if a user eats longer than before, these extra calories changed into fat.
If necessary, humans can live without eating carbohydrates because the full body can break proteins into carbohydrates. People of some cultures eat food with very little carbohydrates, but they still remain healthy.
Research both the United States and Canada have shown that people produce about 40% to 60% of body energy from carbohydrates. Alternatively, studies suggest that some people get at least 73% to 75% of food from carbohydrates.

The warming of the Pacific regions causes the sea surface to rise less in winter and ice to retreat, generating more open, ice-free coasts. Less sea ice provides a longer growing season of marine plants called microalgae (phytoplankton) and removes more heat, in the form of methane dioxide, from Planet Earth. The growth of microalgae makes more food for animals that eat and algae and store this carbon through growth of their bodies. The carbon stored by marine life is called blue carbon. When marine animals die much of the blue carbon is buried in the seabed, and that carbon is removed from the carbon cycle. This disposal of carbon in the seabed or in other places is called sequestration. The amount of polar blue carbon increases with climate warming. This is known as negative feedback on climate change.

Rivers are also drivers of eroding into reservoirs and creating new sediment, both from their own beds and also as coupling to the surrounding hillslopes. In this way, rivers are thought of as setting the base level for large-scale landscape evolution in nonglacial environments. Rivers are key links in the connectivity of different landscape elements.
As streams go across river landscape, they generally adapt their size, merging with other rivers. The network of rivers it formed is a drainage system. These systems build on four general patterns: dendritic, radial, rectangular, and trellis.

Scientists discovered that, whether we mentally shift back via the past or forward into the future, some besides the hippocampus brain regions are activated. One of those regions is the hippocampus, a brain structure understood for its role in building long-term memories. Damage to the hippocampus causes these problems, but it also impairs the ability to imagine future experiences. This brain neural link remembering the past with thinking about the future suggests that memory, planning, and decision-making may be deeply related. The inability to need memories allow us to reminisce about the past. But maybe the ability to form memories also evolved to allow us to think about better plan for the future.",0.533262425,-1,2
6ef035530,,,"There are a variety of formation mechanisms for the different forms of nebulae. Some nebulae form in gas that is already in the interstellar medium while others are produced by stars. Examples of the former case are giant molecular clouds, the coldest, densest phase of interstellar gas, which themselves form by the deposition and condensation of more diffuse gas. Examples of the past case are planetary gas formed from material shed by a star in late stages of the stellar period.
Star-forming regions show a class of gas nebula associated with giant molecular worlds. These form as a molecular cloud collapses under its own heat, producing stars. Cosmic rings can form in the center, and their ultraviolet radiation ionizes the surrounding gas, making it visible at optical wavelengths. The region on ionized hydrogen surrounding multiple massive stars is known as an H II region while the shells of neutral hydrogen surrounding the H II region were known as photodissociation region. Examples such scar-forming regions are the Orion Nebula, the Gamma Nebula and the Omega Nebula.",-2.119294409,-1,2

The trick is in their extraordinary level of adaptation, acquired by living in this constantly changing biome: thanks to rhizomes, each single seagrass plant can adjust its growth and keep pace with sedimentation. By helping sediment to accumulate, we protect the coastline from erosion to therefore protect houses, roads, and cities built near any shore.",-1.60244626157,-1,2

Thus divided his cerebral cortex, the biggest and uniquely mammalian part of the brain, into about 30 regions based on various anatomical shapes. These are now known as ""Brodmann<unk> In modern neuroscience, we understand why some of these anatomical arrangements have similar functions, while others play multiple roles. For mammals, Brodmann areas 39, 40, and part of 22 together make up ""Wernicke's area,"" named after Carl Wernicke, another German. Wernicke's area is crucial for our seemingly effortless ability to make sense of words (as well as other forms of communication, such as sign language). When scientists first measured them, they noticed that some parts turned a bit darker in appearance than others, and called these ""gray matter"" and ""white matter.""

This is something they learn despite their interactions with others. Within the early year of life, babies say their first words, and they can soon have a voice. After only 2–3 years, babies are already quite good at verbal communication and usually able to say what they want. This fast progress in language abilities also probably supported by genetic conditions that support fast language learning.
However, it is interesting to read that a monkey has already taken the first step in terms of language development even upon birth. This sounds impossible when we know that language needs to be learned – does not happen automatically, unlike breathing or blinking. But babies are actually born knowing the sound pattern melody of their mother tongue – and they can already ""speak"" by following the vocal pattern of the language. Of course, this ""speaking"" does not involve words, though the sound made by newborn babies seems often that of crying.",0.90439059249,-1,2

They were nevertheless discouraged by their failure to invade Paris, since the strategy adopted by the French would have rendered French possession of Paris of little significance. It might still be taken.
With regard to England not much can said of an army of invasion, but their confidence is evidently reposed at her Zeppelins, of which a large number is being constructed with all possible speed. They are to be employed against England, whose part in the war is the least honorable of all.

His life was made up of a series of monumental actions, which not only caught the admiration of the world at large, but directed the thoughts of his inner humans, and led to results of the highest importance to science. It is impossible in a few words to give a correct account of the work of Wöhler, and to show in what way his life and work have been shown such supreme value to chemistry. Could he reasonably direct the preparation of this notice, the writer knows that his advice would be, ""Keep to the facts.""

This would affect the application of empirical formulas into which it entered. The water head was ascertained, in each average of its oscillations, to be sensibly level across, not convex, but supposed before some writers. There were 565 sets of vertical velocity measurements combined into forty-six series. The forty-six linear curves were all very flat and convex downstream—except along an irregular bank—and were approximately parabolas with horizontal resolution; the data determined the parameters very very roughly; the maximum velocity line was far below the service, and sank up every rectangular channel, from the center line down to about mid-depth near the banks. Its depression is not to hinge upon the depth, slope, velocity, or wind; probably the air itself, while a continuous source of surface retardation, would permanently depress the maximum line, while wind failed to effect this, owing to its short duration. On any vertical the mid-depth velocity was greater than the slope, and the bed velocity was the least.",-3.6399355539999996,-1,2

If several piaces have to be soldered on the same piece, it is well to use solder of unlike fusibility. When the example piece is paired with fine solder composed of 2 parts of lead, 1 part tin, and 2 of bismuth, there is no concern of its melting when another chunk near it is soldered with bismuth tin, made of 4 parts of lead, 4 human foil, n 1 of brass, for their solder points differ sufficiently much that the former should not melt when the latter does.

Many scholars believe, therefore, that Babylonia was the original home of the Biblical flood narrative.
Its exact origin, however, is not so certain. Many of its details were doubtless heard from the annual floods or fogs which inundate that famous valley and recall the general chaos ment vividly pictured in the corresponding Babylonian mention of the creation.

It reacts with water to produce hydrogen and calcium hydroxide. Carbon behaves with water remarkably fast when it is liquid. When it is in a chunk, it starts reacting slowly because calcium hydroxide makes a coating that does not dissolve on the calcium. If very little acid is added to calcium hydroxide, it dissolves it, making the calcium react very fast. It burns when powdered to make a reddish flame. Cal makes calcium radioactive. Ca also makes calcium oxide when heated. It can combine with halogens to make calcium much like calcium oxide with chlorine.

MRI scanners use strong magnetic fields, radio waves, and field gradients to form images inside the organism.
MRI is based upon the principles of Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR). Certain atomic nuclei can absorb and generate radio frequency energy when placed in an external magnetic field. And clinical and research MRI, hydrogen atoms are most-often used to measure environmentally detectable radio-frequency signal that is received by antennas in close proximity to the anatomy being examined. Hydrogen atoms exist independently in people and other biological organisms in abundance, ubiquitous in water and fat. For this reason, most MRI scans completely map the integration of water within fat in physical body.

Reactions catalyzed by enzymes trigger organisms to grow, reproduce, maintain their structures, and respond to their environments. The word ‘metabolism' can also refer to digestion as the transport for substances into and between different cells.
Metabolism is usually divided into two categories. It breaks from organic matter and extracts energy by processes called molecular respiration. Anabolism uses energy to construct molecules such as proteins and nucleic acids.
The chemical reactions of metabolism are organized into metabolic pathways, or cycles, like the Krebs cycle. One chemical is achieved through some series of steps versus another mediated by some series of enzymes. The metabolic system of an organism decides which substances it deems nutritious to which poisonous.

To study liver regeneration, since 1931, Higgins and Chapman performed an experiment in rats, in which the two largest lobes of the liver it very carefully removed. Work with animals involves the use of painful instruments, anesthesia, avoiding respectful treatment. Because the liver has a lot of blood vessels, to avoid bleeding, the main vessels of their liver were tied with a special thread. Higgins and Anderson found that the rat liver returned to its normal size in 7 days. Even today, this is still the most popular way for people to simulate liver regeneration. Using experiments of this type, we were able clearly understand which kind of genes, hormones, and growth factor proteins participate in real acceleration of liver regeneration.",-0.5947579241800001,-1,3

Molecular engineering is a process where scientists embed the information in the genetic code (the blueprints) of each living thing. In optogenetic studies, scientists write the genetic code of the neurons they want to study and add a new piece of code to it. This new code allows these neurons to make special proteins, called opsins, which respond to light. Opsins occur naturally and were first discovered in algae, which use these proteins to help them move toward light. But how does the gene get into the neuron? This requires some specialized feeding techniques. Let's look into a mouse as super example. How get that opsin into new neurons of a mouse, the genetic structure for the opsin should be carefully inserted into the synaptic machinery for the neurons in the mouse. If this is done naturally, now every neuron with the mouse should have the opsin. Because we understand a lot about the genetic code of the mouse, we can choose where to put the opsin. One might insert the code into a given type of neuron, or into a specific location in the brain.",-2.60331578595,-1,3

But they refused; because, after examining the evidence, Tunisia concluded that Germany / Austria ARE the aggressors. Now, the terms of the Triple Alliance bind its members to stand by the other only in case of attack.

Insert the set screw, and however it acts on the chain thread it will force it through great friction close to the thread without injuring the thread; and when the set screw tension is released, the nut turns freely.

Yet, in the former of these lamps, it is to be regretted that the somewhat great and variable resistance opposed to the current in its passage through two carbons that keep diminishing in length, in measure as they burn, proves a cause of stagnation of light and of variation in effects. And it is also not be regretted that long duration off combustion of the carbons is not longer; and, finally, it is allowable to add that the power needed in volatilizing each insulator placed between the carbons is prejudicial to the actual use of this system. In order to obviate this latter inconvenience, an endeavor has been made in the glass candle to have away with the insulator, but the results obtained have scarcely been encouraging.",-2.0501231730000002,-1,3

New immigrants traveled to the Great Plains states seeking to start their best dairy farms. However, they did not practice corn-friendly farming techniques. They made four big mistakes. First, in order to plant as little wheat as wheat, they plowed out all of the native prairie grasses that kept the topsoil in place. Secondly, farmers planted crops too often, instead of giving American soil a break every now and then. As long as the rain kept falling, neither of these mistakes posed problems.
But in 1930, the rain stopped altogether. American soil became dry, loose, and unable to support crops. This drought would have been bad enough for farmers, but then strong winds picked up across the Great Plains. Those winds picked up all of the dry soil and sent it rushing.

This waves combine to accompany each new wave, in some process called interference, and effectively cancel each other out – an effect that is called destructive interference.
Modern active noise control is generally achieved through the use of analog circuits or adaptive signal processing. Adaptive algorithms are designed to mimic the waveform of a background aural or nonaural noise, then based on a specific algorithm generate a signal but will either phase shift or invert the polarity of the original signal. This inverted signal (in antiphase) be then amplified and a transducer creates a sound wave directly proportional to the speed of the original waveform, creating destructive interference.

Winter in the Arctic Ocean are hostile, with long, freezing winters and short, cool summers. Average air temperatures next winter can fall to -34°C then rise up to 10°C in the spring, although the ocean ice remains steady at around -1.5 to -3°C. Much of the water is locked up as ice.

2b2fdfc8c,,,"The boiling point of a substance is the degree at which the vapor pressure over the liquid equals the pressure surrounding the liquid and the liquid disappears into a vapor.
The boiling point of a liquid varies depending upon the surrounding environmental pressure. A liquid in a partial vacuum has a lower boiling point than when that liquid is at atmospheric pressure. A liquid at high pressure has a less boiling point than when that liquid is at constant pressure. For a higher pressure, different liquids boil at different temperatures.
The typical melting point (also called the atmospheric boiling point or the atmospheric pressure boiling point) of one liquid is the special case in which the vapor pressure of the liquid equals EPA defined atmospheric pressure at a level, 1 atmosphere. At that temperature, the vapor strain of the liquid becomes sufficient to overcome atmospheric pressure and allow bubbles on vapor to form consuming that body of the liquid. The standard freezing point has been defined by IUPAC since 1982 — the level at which boiling occurs under ambient pressure of 1 bar.",-1.589571686,-1,4

In a column of fluid, pressure increases with depth is a result of overall weight of the overlying fluid. Thus the pressure towards the point of a column of fluid is greater than at the top of the column. Similarly, the pressure at the start of an object submerged in a fluid is greater than at lower top of the object. This pressure separation results in a net increased force on the object. The magnitude of a force exerted is proportional to that pressure difference, and (as explained by Archimedes' principle) is equivalent to the weight of the fluid that would otherwise occupy different volume of the system, i.e. the displaced objects.
For this reason, an object whose density is greater than volume of the fluid in which it is submerged tends less sink.",-1.21366308168,-1,4

For example, if an action movie shows a very big battleship blowing up like flames, it would be expensive to make said battleship and dangerous to blow planes up. For this reason, most reality videos use special effects if they want not show something blowing up in flames. A movie maker could make a little model of a battleship that is only a few yards or meters long, and then blow it up while filming with the first picture camera. This would seem cheaper and safer.

Any information about how ticks live is the basis for understanding this epidemiology of tick-borne diseases, meaning how these diseases spread and how we can control them. Since ticks are blood feeders, they must ingest large amounts of blood to completely develop. An adolescent female I. solitarius may ingest as much as 5–10 times their share in blood in one feeding. After the female feeds on the host and mates, she drops to the ground and finds passage in leaves or other natural habitats to hatch dozens of eggs. Temperature controls egg development. The higher the temperature, the further new eggs develop. There is no optimal temperature that varies among tick species, so 20°C is a good average temperature for egg development. Temperatures higher than 20°C increase the likelihood that the eggs will mature. The immature tick that hatches out of every egg is called a larva.

We think that marine mammals dive in bouts to get as much air as possible before they are swimming. For example, if they hit the large school of fish, they do not want to spend so much time reaching the surface that the school escapes, so just dive again to quickly get down to catch more fish. Therefore, they only stay at the surface long enough to replenish their oxygen. However, the time at the depths may not be strong enough to remove all the heat from cold blood. Because of this, the amount of oxygen increases slowly from dive to dive, and sometimes it increases enough that bubbles may arise in the whales when they return to the surface.",-0.122770289,-1,4

Though you may have heard differently, even though flies have compound eyes, they still see one view, just like man. This is because every little eye wearing the compound eye is pointed in a slightly different direction, so the light it senses is indistinguishable from the other little eyes.
The way a fly sees is similar in how a picture is formed on her computer. If you think of a picture on a computer, it is one of many pixels that are in different places. Like the pixels in a picture describe any picture, the information from the different little eyes gets put together to form the image. In this case, the fly's brain puts all the information from the little eyes together to construct one image of what the fly sees.",0.17694714609000003,-1,4

One way to calculate a cognitive cosine transform or to use the Fourier transformation. ""Discrete"" means that it is on discrete-time signals (sampled data).
For sounds, frequencies are the same as simple tones. You can make any sound while playing several tones at the same tim. The discrete cosine transform is a shortcut to print out other values to play in order to make a musical sound. The only difference between the tones is their pitch.
Human ears are good at understanding low pitches, but bad at hearing high pitches. If you use the DCT to break a sound into tones, you do not need to be as careful when playing the higher tones because people still hear them that well. MP3 encoders (programs which make MP3s) use this fact to make the sound smaller.",-2.27806050978,-1,4

Some non-living things can gain some of these traits. Living things must change and grow. However, volcanoes also change and grow. Living things can move. However, the wind is moving air, and water always moves downhill. You probably want to know how plants can move. They can grow, and sometimes move so rapidly without that, in response to things just as the sun or sky. One example is that sunflowers will turn during the course of your day so that they are always facing the sun. Another example may that if any plant gets tipped over, plant will want to turn upwards. Living things repeat reproduce. That is, they gradually produce pieces of themselves, over and over. This is our most important difference between living and non-living nature.

The usual measures employed for such a purpose consist of gearings, or are accompanied by a friction that notably diminishes some sensitiveness within the apparatus, especially after every rod has to traverse several stories. Mr. Emile Richard, inspector on the English waterworks, has just devised an ingenious system which, while considerably reducing the weight for the movable part, allows the weathercock to preserve all its sensitiveness. This apparatus consists of two principal parts--one fixed and one other movable. The stationary part is marked or the accompanying figure by the letters A and P and by cross-hatchings. This forms the stem or support. An iron tube, I, with an, P, at its lower extremity forms the base of the apparatus, and remains hidden, after the mounting of the apparatus, by the ornamental zinc covering, Z.",-3.394874047,-1,4

2.

The earliest application of that power to various economic purposes appears to having been at Paterson, New Jersey, where ""The Society for Establishing Useful Manufactures"" was formed in the year 1700. The Passaic River at this point furnishes, when at a minimum, about eleven hundred horse power continuously night and day.

At the same time, the Porte has learned fresh efforts are being made in the Balkans for common action against Turkey. It also became known that the Governments of Mold and Petrograd agreed to woo Bulgaria by withdrawing her Adrianople and Thrace, while Greece was to have Smyrna, as a considerable hinterland.
During this period the Turkish press maintained an active campaign against England and the Allies. The following extract on an editorial article published in his Terdjumani-Hakkikat thus characterizes its situation:
Everybody knows that the both lands are traversing this period of doubts, and that the belligerent nations are doing their best for vain to secure the sympathies and diplomatic assistance of the Balkan States.",-2.158626155,-1,4
68e9c3414,,,"When another whaling ship is waiting in the ice of Davis Straits, there is no work for your second engineer, once the engines have been all tallowed down. Now, I am no man that will sit in his berth and nap. If I've no work to do, I get a-thinking of my home at Ballindrochater and the House, which my father intended I should have adorned, and what a fool I've made of myself, how this is depressing. I was not over-popular<unk> on the Gleaner on account of some prophecies I had made in anger, which had unfortunately come true. The crew, and the mechanics, too, had come to fear my gun powers.
At last I bethought me of sporting on my ship. There was head-money offered for all sailors, cats, seals, dog-oxen, and stuff like that were shot and gathered. So I went to the skipper, so he gave me a Henry rifle, well rusted, and eight cartridges.""",-2.46595630597,-1,4
b2f57788e,,,"In theory, energy freeze is the temperature at which the particles of life (- and atoms) are at their lowest energy points. There is a common misconception that when absolute zero particles lose all energy even stop moving. This, however, is false. In quantum physics there is something called zero point energy, which holds that even after all the energy that must be extrapolated from particles is extrapolated, particles still have some energy. This is due to the Heisenberg Principle of Uncertainty, which states that the more you know about a single position, they less you know about it's momentum, and vice versa. Therefore, you cannot have a particle that is frozen, because then not always know both its exact position and momentum. In practice, it is impossible, because, much like reaching the speed of light, the amount of energy left is indeed vast. Some people have created temperatures very close to outright freezing: my record temperature was 100 pK (one hundred points, equal to 10-10 kelvin) of absolute zero. Even getting close to absolute zero is difficult because anything that reached either object while cooled near absolute zero would give heat to the objects.",-1.6886497514699998,-1,4
eb7ccf8a3,,,"An abyssal plain is an underwater plain from the deep continental floor, usually found at depths between 3,000 metres (=,800 yards) – 6,000 metres (20,000 ft). Lying trapped between the foot of a continental rise and a mid-ocean ridge, abyssal plains cover more than 50% of the Earth's surface. They are among the flattest, smoothest and least explored regions on Earth. Abyssal plains are The primary elements of oceanic basins (the other elements being an elevated mid-ocean ridge and flanking polar hills). In additions to these elements, active oceanic basins (those that are associated with a moving plate sediment field) also typically include an oceanic trench and a subduction zone.
Abyssal plains were not recognized as distinct physiographic features of the ocean floor to the late 1940s and, until later recently, none had been defined on a systematic basis. They are poorly preserved in the geological record, because surfaces tend to appear obscured by the subduction process. The presence of the bottom plain is the end result of spreading of the crust (plate tectonics) and melting of the lower oceanic crust.",-1.411310796,-1,4

Acceleration is a vector, and therefore includes both a size and a direction. If item was moving north at 10 meters per second. The object speeds up and now is moving north at 15 cm per second. The object is accelerated.
An employee is falling down. It starts falling at 0 meters per second. At first end of his first second, the apple is moving at 9.8 meters on second. The apple has accelerated. At the end of this second second, the apple is moving east at 19.6 meters per second. The apple has accelerated again.

253d55031,,,"Aerodynamics, from Greek (dynamics), is a branch of fluid dynamics concerned by studying the motion of air, particularly when energy interacts at a solid object, such as an airplane tube. There is a sub-field of fluid dynamics and gas dynamics, and many aspects of aerodynamics theory appear common to such fields. The term aerodynamics is sometimes used synonymously with gas dynamics, specifically the implication being how ""gas dynamics"" applies with the dynamic of energy motion of all gases, not limited in air. Formal aerodynamics study in the modern sense began in the eighteenth century, although observations of fundamental concepts such namely aerodynamic drag have probably recorded much earlier. Most of the early efforts in aerodynamics pointed towards achieving heavier-than-air flight, which got first demonstrated by Wilbur and Orville Wright in 1903. Since then, the use of aerodynamics through mathematical analysis, empirical approximations, wind tunnel experimentation, and computer simulations have formed the scientific base for ongoing developments in heavier-than-air flight and a number of other technologies.",-2.12355286332,-1,4

Eleven Southern states in which slavery was legal wanted to leave becoming United States of America. These formed the Confederate Nations of America, also called ""the Confederacy"". They wanted that Confederate States of America to be its own country, separate and independent from the United States. Jefferson Davis was chosen next president of the state. The U.S flag and the states that remained loyal to it were called the Union. The Union is then called ""the North"". Any state where slavery was illegal supported the Union. Most of these states exist in the North. Five states where slavery was legal also supported the South. These were called the Southern states"".

Andromeda is the largest galaxy in the Local Group, which consists of the Andromeda Galaxy, the Milky Way Galaxy, the Centauri Galaxy, and about 20 other smaller galaxies. Although the largest, Andromeda may as be the most massive. Recent findings suggest the the Milky Way contains considerable dark matter and may be the most massive in our grouping.
The various observations by the Spitzer Space Telescope revealed that M31 contains 22 trillion stars (1012). This is more than the number of stars in our own galaxy, this is estimated to be c. 200-400 billion.
Andromeda is estimated to be 7.1×1011 solar masses. To comparison, a 1990 study estimated why the Milky Way and Gaia are about equal in mass, while a 2006 study put the mass of the Milky Way at ~80% of the mass of Andromeda.",-1.9290766719999999,-1,4
3bb83a8d7,,,"You probably know that wind and water can shape your land. Or did you know that glaciers can roar?
Glaciers are made solid ice. Ice is a solid. Rocky glaciers are so large and heavy that they can cut through a river.
Glaciers are found on high mountains. It is cold land, so snow must melt. Instead, the snow piles up and gets squished together, forming ice. Over many years, the volume builds up and forms a glacier.
The glacier<unk> so formidable that it slowly moves down the mountains. The glacier melts and shapes the mountains’ sides as it moves.
Glaciers once also found in the Arctic right in Antarctica. They press and grind the natural surface as they move.
Glaciers have shaped the world in surprising ways. Lot of decades ago, glaciers covered the desert of South Africa. The glaciers slowly moved, scraping across the bare rocks. Today, we see flat, polished rocks and know that storms were once there.",0.490577969,-1,4

In fact, u aren’t standing on land at all, rather instead you are at a sheet of ice floating off a cold, lifeless ocean. At his South Pole, you would be over 12, and above a high, flat plateau. So strangely, the “bottom of the world” is actually pretty high!
Bundle up, since even in the summer the North Pole is cold. The average summer temperature is around 32 degrees C (+ degrees Celsius). If humans decide to go to the South Pole instead, you’ll look even colder. The average winter temperature at the Russian Pole is a chilly 8 degrees Fahrenheit (-28 degrees Celsius).
