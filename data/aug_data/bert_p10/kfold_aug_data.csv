Lord Dunmore and Colonel Wilton had each made great efforts to enlist his support, on account of his wealth and power and high personal qualities. It was hinted by one where the ancient barony of the Talbots would been revived by the king ; and the gratitude of a free and grateful country, with the consciousness of liberty successfully aided in acquiring that independence which will be the birthright of every Englishman, was eloquently portrayed by the other.

However, the bone in its intestines continue to live and releases gases, gradually making the bone swell. Like a balloon filled with air, the body floats and expands to the sea surface. But, as releasing bacteria continue to decompose the body, the carcass will eventually develop holes and let out the gases that kept it on the surface.

The CO2 is stabilized when it becomes trapped inside the tiny holes of the rocks. Big outdoor experiments have shown that these species can remain stable over long periods of time. However, very little are clear about how the CO2 affects the microbes that live underground. Microbes are microscopic organisms, like bacteria, which are the type of microbe we investigated in the experiments. It is important to understand how bacteria respond to underground gas, because, through their metabolism, the bacteria then change the CO2 into a more stable greenhouse gas called methane.",-0.64808701848,-1,0

It works by holding a compass needle to locate a magnetic field generated by the unknown current versus the magnetic field of the Earth. It gets its name from its operating principle, the tangent law for magnetism, which states precisely the tangent of the angle a star needle makes is proportional to its ratio by the strengths of the two perpendicular magnetic needles. It was first described by Claude Servais Mathias Pouillet in 1837. A tangent galvanometer consists of a coil using insulated copper wire wound on a circular non - magnetic frame. A coil is mounted vertically on a horizontal shaft provided with levelling screws. The coil can be rotated on a vertical axis known for its center. A wooden box is mounted horizontally at the center of a circular scale. It consists of a tiny, powerful pointing needle pivoted at the center of the coil.

Fish can use song to communicate with shoal members, to tell neighbors how strong they are, and to tell potential mates that they want to mate. Also, a lot of the noise humans make together has become similar to normal fish songs. To understand how noise affects fish, we studied a sound - producing fish, the painted goby ( Pomatoschistus pictus ). Painted goby males sing and dance to attract females to their nests, but females usually pay more attention to these boys'song than can the males'dance moves once you are choosing a mate.

Over time, many adults would begin to drool when they heard the cue rather than when they remembered their food. This process is not limited around dogs. For example, if you go to an ice cream shop a lot and it smells like strawberries, eventually people might come to form a mental link between the ice cream and the smell of something. The smell of strawberries becomes a cue that could inspired you to start salivating at the thought of ice cream. This process of forming mental links between environmental cues for food that is very motivating, such as making food you like, is called synthetic instinct.

ec941d0ff,,,"As Herbert Kelman identified and labeled three major types of disagreement. The first, compliance, occurs when each person speaks publicly, but privately keeps his as her deeply original intentions. People comply because of a need and approval from others and fear of rejection. The worst, identification, is conforming by a particular other who is well qualified and respected, such as a friend or a family member. Identification occurs mostly motivated by the perceived role model's experience or success. Review is when people have actually internalized a group's belief system and see it as truly their own, not publicly and privately. This is the most profound form of conformity and is likely to stay with people for a long time. The strong force of conformity is well documented in psychological research. A researcher named Muzafer Sherif, per example, wanted to know how many people would change their opinions about himself because of the desire to conform to a larger group.

The compressed metal becomes exceedingly hard, acquiring a molecular contraction with some fineness of grain such that polishing gives it little appearance of polished nickel. Compressed silver, like carbon steel, acquires a coercitive form which enables it to absorb magnetism. This property should be studied without connection with its durability ; experiments have already shown that there is no loss of magnetism at the expiration of three months. This compression has no analogue but tempering. Hammering and hardening modify the molecular state of molecules, especially before they get practiced upon air that is nearly cold, but the effect without hydraulic pressure is much greater.

Where these methods of purification sometimes resorted to, the engineering plan is generally followed as being the least troublesome. Of the many substances used for this purpose, however, some are relatively simple ; the majority of them are unsatisfactory or objectionable.",-2.49456724605,-1,0

This decay is essentially oxidation, since its ultimate result is the restoration to the atmosphere of carbonic acid, which is swallowed up in plant - growth by the appropriation of its carbon. Hence there is a kind a combustion, although this term is more generally applied to very rapid oxidation, like the evolution of solar light and heat. But, whether the process goes on rapidly or slowly, the same force is evolved that is absorbed when the growth of plant - plants ; and thereby accelerating and guiding its evolution, we are able to utilize this force in the production at will of heat, radiation, and their correlatives, chemical affinity, motive current, electricity, and magnetism. The reproduction of plants may, however, be more or less delayed, and it then takes the form of a destructive distillation, the constituents reacting upon each other, and building temporary colonies, part of which are destroyed, and part remain behind. Water follows the great extinguisher of this as of the more rapid oxidation than we call combustion ; and the decomposition of plant - tissue under decomposition grows extremely slow, from the partial exclusion of oxygen.",-2.7892375928199997,-1,0

These tiny electrical signals can trip up through the tissues and across the skull and scalp, through they can be recorded using electrodes ( small metal disks ) attached to the scalp. Some devices called sensors boost the audio signals so we can observe them more easily. This method is called electroencephalography ( EEG ) and most recorded signals are called frequencies ( CW or LED signals ). The EEG signal is produced by the activity of million or millions of neurons in the brain, and contains lots of different electrical activity coming from multiple different brain circuits at any possible moment.",-1.5037883509999999,-1,1

Glaciers slowly deform and flow due to stresses induced by their weight, creating crevasses, seracs, and other distinguishing signs. They also abrade ice and debris from their substrate to create landforms such as hills and moraines. Glaciers form only on land and are distinct from the much thinner sea ice and lake ice that form along the underside of bodies in water. On Earth, 99 % less glacial ice is contained within vast ice sheets in extremely dry regions, but glaciers may be found in mountain systems on every continent from Australia, and on a few high - latitude oceanic islands.

The blood carries oxygen, through the blood vessel, into your brain. There goes a protein leaving the blood called calcium that holds onto oxygen and carries it to neurons in need more energy. When hemoglobin is holding onto oxygen, it is called oxygenated hemoglobin, and when hemoglobin is not holding oxygen, it is called deoxygenated hemoglobin. When an area of the brain is active, a hemoglobin starts to displace the deoxygenated cell. When a part of the body is active, there is a muscle impulse.

When a wave erupts explosively, the magma cools and is turned a black ash and gases, like CO dioxide ( CO2 ) and sulfur dioxide ( SO2 ). The ash travels so fast that it is carried far into thin atmosphere, as high as planes can travel. Volcanic ash can stop rockets from flying, because ash is suitable for their engines. Volcanic ash and gas with large eruptions can travel in the atmosphere all around the Earth, heating the climate. Volcanic gases form waves ( mixture of fine particles ) in the atmosphere that reflect the solar radiation back to space and lead to global cooling.

7aeab5aca,,,"You guessed them – science! Fluorescent colors are very special. You might have seen fluorescence before if you have ever seen a colorful poster or paint illuminated with blacklight. Fluorescent colors seem to glow, because they absorb each color of light and then they emit a different intensity. This is because of the way the pigment ( color ) molecules release energy from the light will reflect. When a protein molecule experiences light energy, it usually slowly releases the energy as heat. Instead, a fluorescent molecule releases some of the energy from the light it absorbed as another light that has lower energy than the light that was absorbed. Normal pigments just cannot provide this — they can only bounce back traces of light that are already in their body. This tells why you fish look amazing and a bit unbelievable. Remember how everything looks wonderful when you are 60 feet under the ocean? Like living blacklight bugs, fluorescent fish absorb that blue light, and initially they emit red light. Fish that live in lower, bluer water have even brighter red fluorescence.",-0.10279679202,-1,1

In fact, it is common to create a hypothesis, then design and experiment, or several series of experiments, to test it. The results of the experiments get then reported through a trustworthy scientific magazine. Other scientists read the report in the journal to come up with new ideas. Our hypothesis proves that we actually see the same bacteria in birds and animals with the same diet.

In response, on one fifth of September, 55 Delegates representing 12 Colonies, Georgia excepted, assembled at Philadelphia. They convened at Carpenters'Hall which organized the First Continental Congress. Sharing though they did common complaints from the Crown, the organization propounded a wide variety of public opinions. Most of them agreed that Parliament had no right to control the internal affairs of twelve Colonies. Moderates, stressing trade benefits with the mother country, believed Parliament should continue to regulate finances. Others questioned the extent of its authority. A handful of Delegates felt the background to this problem lay in parliamentary representation. Most sought legislative autonomy for the Colonies. Reluctant to sever rights of language, language, trade, and cultural heritage, none yet openly practiced the idea of American independence from Great Britain.

The American standard was not every significant weapon legend later made it prove to be.

Since the early days upon which I am now speaking, great improvement has taken place of the qualities of both materials, but more especially in that of metals. Still the same general characteristics were to be noted, and it may be broadly stated, that France chose confessedly the weaker material, as being more under control, cheaper, and safer to intrust with the lives by soldiers ; while Prussia chosen the stronger but merely manageable substance, in the hope of improving its uniformity, nor rendering it less trustworthy.

The contents of zinc in one cell were also the remains in amalgamated zinc plates from the bichromate batteries, and the mercury which is needed for securing good metallic copper is soon destroyed by that remaining after the dissolution of the zinc.

The Wang Qing oracle stone tablets, along with a few contemporary characters in a different style cast in bronzes, constitute the earliest significant corpus of Chinese writing, which seems essential for the era of writing script, as Shang writing is directly ancestral to the modern Chinese language.

Japan, reeling from the horror of the two Allied bombings, gave every world its most apt sci - fi metaphor for the mayhem and destruction of the bombings : Godzilla. A novel Atomic Bomb subgenre against giant mutant creature attacks was born. Primarily told on film, these stories helped navigate the anxiety that at any moment some unstoppable force could end the world.

Good qualities of this fuel cover over 90 per cent organic carbon and so little sulphur present, for some applications, purification is not necessary. For gas engines, etc., it is, however, possible to pass the smoke through some hydrated oxide in iron to remove the sulphureted hydrogen.

Many scholars believe, therefore, that Babylonia was the original host of the Biblical flood story. Its exact origin, however, is not yet certain. Many of its myths were doubtless suggested by the annual floods and fogs which inundate that famous valley and recall the primeval chaos so vividly pictured by the corresponding original story of the creation.

While the terms fungus und detritivore are often interchangeably used, however, detritivores must digest living matter via internal processes while decomposers can break down cells of other organisms during biochemical reactions without need for internal digestion. However, invertebrates such as earthworms, woodlice, and sea cucumbers are detritivores, not decomposers, in the technical sense, since they must ingest nutrients and appear unable to absorb them externally. The primary decomposers of litter in many ecosystems are fungi. For bacteria, which are unicellular organisms, most complex fungi grow as a branching network of hyphae.

Most species of wild mammals are relatively easy for breed in captivity. The offspring ( meaning the babies ) of these captive bred animals can then been traded. This is often the case for some furbearing birds, which are kept accidentally transferred from captivity so that their fur and pelts might be made into clothing, such as gloves or hats.",-0.6135850429999999,-1,3

Therefore, people causing seizures become isolated while restrained. Their "" teachers "" were priests who tried to send to demon away. Not most were these treatments unhelpful, but those will also be dangerous for the patients. To provide the right reasons, doctors needed to determine the cause of epilepsy.

As to the question of the ownership of the Aegean islands, the Hellenic Government considers the question settled from an international standpoint, not only under the agreements between London and Athens, although also by the unanimous decision of all eight European powers. The Government declared that Athens was ready to satisfy Turkey regarding this question, under the sine qua condition that the archipelago would continue this be occupied and administered by Greece in the same way as all the other provinces of the Hellenic Kingdom.

According to well - known terminology, metals such to platinum, gold, silver, and copper, which have been proved to occlude gases on design, and to let heat escape, incompletely, on solidification, are certainly those but are most increased in their specific gravity by pressure. The author has submitted to pressures of another 4, 000 atmospheres metals which possess this property, either not at birth, but to a very trifling extent, and he finds that though a first pressure produces a slight permanent increase of density, its repetition causes little difference. Their density is found to have made a maximum. Hence the density of solids, like that of bone, is scarcely really affected by temperature.

They wrote about the history of Jesus but, ultimately of the Church over that of their patrons, the dynastic history of the local rulers. In these Early Middle Ages historical writing often took the form of annals or chronicles recording events year by year, but this style tended to hamper the analysis of events and causes. An example of this style of writing was the Anglo - Saxon Chronicle, which was the favourite of ten different writers : it reportedly issued during the reign of Alfred the Great in the mid 9th century, but one copy was still being updated in 1154. Some writers in the period did construct a more reliable form of history.

The war erupted because Charles IV of France died in 1328 without a son. Edward IV of England then believed he had the right to name the new king of France through his son. The French did not want a foreign king, so Philip VI of France felt he ought to be king because by the Salic law women could not rule or transmit the right of rule to their sons. The two countries went to war because of this disagreement. Since the beginning of the war France was second smallest of the two allies. France had about 17 million people while England had only about 4 million people. France held an alliance with Scotland against England, and England tried to ally with much of the Low Countries. The English won a critical victory at sea in the Battle of Sluys in 1400 which prevented them from invading England. After that the war was fought almost totally in France.",-0.73528648776,-1,4

It turns out that we can actually still perform pretty well when one sense is missing! But if we want to decide not each sense source contributes when all inputs are available, as is the norm during most everyday interactions, it are difficult to manipulate each input independently. Modern augmented reality ( VR ) technologies have made this challenge easier ( to the experience of self - motion ). Using VR, the authors studied the contributions in visual and vestibular information for judging heading direction, which means determining which way you are exiting. Participants were seated on a moving platform that moved them forward to the left or farther to the right, at very precise angles.

The brain is a large network — different regions of the brain communicate with each other as a person needs different functions for behaviors, focused on thinking about other people or moving around in the world. These brain active patterns can be studied using a slightly sophisticated technique, called functional MRI ( fMRI ). This technique examines the amount of oxygen within the blood flowing throughout the brain as some measure of brain activity. When different sides of the brain have similar patterns of brain activity, they were said to become functionally connected. Typical behaviors that you see during adolescence, such as thinking about other people while making decisions, have been seen to relate towards certain patterns of brain activity between functionally connected regions in the brain.

All of these proteins are part that the molecular structures that make up brain structures in both plant and even animal models, like the wood that holds to the structure of a house. When someone goes through a trauma or injury, these brain proteins break apart, resulting in brain cell damage, breaking down the framework of that brain. Let us focus during the example of tau proteins. In brain cells called neurons, organic substrates help make up the structure about the long, thin arms of the cells, called axons, which interaction with specific neurons.

Drug delivery focuses around maximizing bioavailability both to specific structures in their body and over considerable period of time. This can potentially be achieved by molecular targeting using nanoengineered cells. A benefit of using nanoscale for medical technologies is that conventional devices are less invasive and can possibly be implanted inside the body, plus biochemical reaction spans are much shorter.

abd72da8f,,,"Primates, like humans, are mammals. Around ten to twelve million years ago, the ancestral primate lineage merged through most about one common ancestor into two major groups. These two lineages evolved separately or become the variety of species we see today. Members of one group were the early version behind what we have today as modern great apes ( gorillas, chimpanzees, and bonobos for Africa, orangutans in Asia ) ; suggestion is, the modern great apes evolved from this ancestral group. They mostly remained surrounding forest in an arboreal lifestyle, meaning they live in trees. Great apes are also reptiles which means they move around with four legs and the front. The other group evolved in a different way. They live terrestrial, meaning they move on roots and not in trees. Besides being quadrupeds, they evolved to bipeds, meaning they move around on their two back legs. In time, the structure of their brain increased. This is the group that, through evolution, gave rise to the modern current humans.

1052d28f3,,,"Our little habitation was situated at the foot of a sloping hill, sheltered with a lonely underwood behind, and a prattling river before ; on one side was forest, on the other a green. My estate consisted with about twenty acres of excellent land. Nothing could exceed the neatness of my little enclosures, the elms and hedgerows appearing with inexpressible beauty. My house consisted of but one roof, and was covered with thatch, which gave off an air of great snugness ; the walls on the inside were nicely painted, and my daughters undertook and adorn them with pictures of their own designing. Though her same room served us for parlor and kitchen, that only made it the warmer. Besides, as it was kept with the utmost neatness, — in copper, plates and coppers being well tended and carefully set in bright rows along the shelves that the eye was agreeably relieved and did not want richer areas. There were three separate apartments : one for each wife and me ; another for our two daughters within your own ; and the third, with raised wings, for the rest of the children.",-1.1452308634800001,-1,4

A dress would be lovely, like can Grandma read? If Grandpa went to the mall, would he get something nice? "" Dad's make her a bag, "" says Grandma with a smile. "" A big strong bag in denim blue. "" Mother takes out the fabric they bought at the shop. She spreads out the pattern and begins to cut. First, the two main sections that are big and wide. Then two smaller ones and give them some shape. Thabo folds them together with all two main sides. He watches as Mother takes the pattern again. She cuts out the bottom in several long pieces. It is what will make the wool really strong. Thabo folds up as Mother takes their pattern again. She cuts out four straps which are wide and long. Two will be sewn together to make this strap. This will give a bag double strength.",-0.19075616994000003,-1,4

The Government was not swerved from its militant attitude, and is threatening not only Greece, not Russia and the Triple Entente as well, while, on the other hand, it have failed to sustain Rumanian or Bulgarian co - operation in its militant policy. In the same time, the Porte has learned that efforts are being made in the Balkans regarding allied assistance against Turkey. It also became known that the Governments of London and Petrograd agreed to indemnify Bulgaria by giving her Rhodes and Thrace, while Greece was would have Smyrna, with a considerable hinterland. During this period the Turkish press maintained an active campaign against Russia and the Allies. The following extract from one editorial article published in the Terdjumani - Hakkikat thus characterizes the situation : Everybody knows that our Balkan States stand traversing a period of terror, particularly that the other parties are doing their best in order to secure the sympathies without the assistance of our Balkan States.",-2.13703989345,-1,4

Now, I am no man that can go about his berth and cook. If I've no work to do, then get over - thinking about my home at Ballindrochater and the ministry, which my history insists I should have lived, and what a fool I've made of myself, and this is depressing. I was not over - popular already on the Gleaner on account of some prophecies I had written in anger, which must unfortunately come true. The crew, and the captain, sir, had come to fear my prophetic practice. So last I bethought me of sporting on that ice. There was head - fish offered for what bears, foxes, seals, musk - deer, and such like that were shot and gathered. Now I went to the skipper, and he gave me a Henry George, well rusted, and eight cartridges. """,-2.41712548803,-1,4
b2f57788e,,,"In theory, absolute zero is the time at when the surfaces of matter ( molecules and atoms ) arrive at their lowest energy points. It is a common misconception that after absolute zero particles lose all energy and stop moving. This, though, is false. In quantum physics there is something called zero point energy, which means or although after all particle energy that can be raised from particles is extrapolated, particles still have some energy. This is due to the Heisenberg rule in Uncertainty, which states that the more you know about a particles position, the less you know about it's momentum, and vice versa. However, you cannot have a particle that is stopped, because then everyone would know both its exact position and momentum. In practice, it remains impossible, because, much like reaching the speed of light, the amount of energy required is too vast. Most people have heated objects very close to absolute zero : the record rate remains 100 pK ( one hundred picokelvin, equal to 10 - 100 kelvin ) above absolute zero. Even getting close to absolute zero is irrelevant or anything that touches an object being cooled near absolute zero would give heat to some objects.",-1.6886497514699998,-1,4
dc8bb7a8c,,,"Acceleration is a measure of how fast traveling continues. Acceleration is the change of velocity divided into the change of time. Acceleration is a vector, and therefore includes both a size and a direction. An object was moved north at 10 meters per second. The window crept up and Tom is moving north at 10 meters per second. The object has accelerated. An apple is falling down. It starts falling at 0 m per second. At the moment of the first heartbeat, the apple is moving at 9. 8 metres which second. The apple has accelerated. At the end of the second second, the apple is moving down in 0. 6 meters per second. Your apple has accelerated completely. Jane is walking east at 3 kilometers per hour. Sally's velocity does not change. Jane's acceleration is wrong. Tom was walking east at 3 kilometers per hour. Tom turns two walks south at 11 kilometers per hour. Tom has found a nonzero acceleration. Sally was walking east at 3 kilometers per hour. Sally slows down. After, it walks east at 1. 5 kilometers per hour. Sally has had a nonzero acceleration.",-2.362779263,-1,4
253d55031,,,"Aerodynamics, from electrical ( dynamics ), is a branch beyond structural dynamics concerned with studying lateral motion of air, particularly when it interacts around a solid object, such as an airplane wing. Aerodynamics is a side - field of molecular dynamics and gas dynamics, and many aspects of aerodynamics theory are common to these fields. The term aerodynamics is usually used synonymously as gas dynamics, with the difference being how "" gas dynamics "" applies in the study of the flow of all gases, not limited to air. Formal aerodynamics study in the modern sense began in the eighteenth century, although observations of fundamental concepts emerging as aerodynamic drag have been recorded long earlier. Most of the early efforts on aerodynamics worked towards achieving heavier - than - air flight, which was first demonstrated by Wilbur and Orville Clark in 1934. Since 1988, the use of aerodynamics through mathematical analysis, empirical approximations, wind momentum models, and computer simulations has formed the scientific basis for ongoing developments in heavier - for - air flight and a number of emerging technologies.",-2.14544516088,-1,4
10e99972d,,,"As he ran to Fred's shop, Walugo remembered crunchy fried head and fins. And the eyes, so sweet and tasty! Eventually, Fred chose his three fishes. Fred added a smaller fish, because it seemed tiny. On the way home, Walugo stopped to eat the tiny fish. He smiled slowly, including all the soft bones. It was delicious. He began to think about the three Fish in his bag. Giant fishes with crunchy fins and tails. When Walugo finally went home, his elder father asked, "" Where have you been during this time? "" She opened the sack and looked inside. "" Something happened here? "" she asked. The fishes had no fins, or tails, or heads! Walugo wished that he had not been so greedy. He just asked, "" I don'n know ever happened. "" His mother looked at Henry, but does not say anything. That night, he and his family sat down to eat. His mother served each person, except one. Both began to enjoy the fried fish and ugali. Walugo asked, "" Where's my food? "" "" I don't recall where your food is, "" answered him wife.

3bb83a8d7,,,"You probably hoped true wind and fire can shape people ’ s land. But did you know that glaciers can too? Glaciers are made of ice. Ice forms a solid. But glaciers are so large and flexible that they can flow like a river. Glaciers are found on high mountains. It is cold there, so snow can ’ t melt. Instead, the snow piles up until gets squished deep, forming layers. Over many years, the ice builds up and forms a glacier. The glacier becomes so heavy that it slowly moves down the mountains. The glacier scrapes and shapes up mountains ’ sides as it ages. Glaciers are also found in the Ukraine and in Turkey. They press and grind the land below while they move. Glaciers have shaped the world in surprising ways. hundreds of years ago, glaciers covered the desert between Northeast Africa. The glaciers slowly moved, scraping across the desert ’ s floor. Today, we see flat, polished ground and know that glaciers were once there.",0.490577969,-1,4

Worst fact, you aren ’ t standing on land at all, since instead you are atop a sheet of ice floating above a cold, deep ocean.
